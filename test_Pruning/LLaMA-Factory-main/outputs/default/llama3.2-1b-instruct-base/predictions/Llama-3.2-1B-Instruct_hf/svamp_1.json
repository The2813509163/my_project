How many peaches does Jake have?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nFirst, we find the number of apples Steven has: 52 + 10 = 62. Then, we find the number of peaches Steven has: 13. Since Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, we subtract 84 from Steven's total: 62 - 84 = -22. Since Jake cannot have a negative number of peaches, we must re-examine the problem. We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, and Steven has 52 apples. Therefore, Jake has 52 + 84 = 136 apples. Since Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, we subtract 10 from Steven's total: 13 - 10 = 3. Therefore, Jake has 3 peaches. The answer is 3.\n\nQuestion: A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day.

Since there are 15 students in total, we subtract 19 from 15 to find the number of students going to the movies, library, or park: 15 - 19 = -4. Since the number of students cannot be negative, we must have counted some students twice. We must subtract the number of students going to both the movies and library, and the number of students going to both the movies and park, and the number of students going to both the library and park: 8 + 7 - 4 = 11.

How many apples does he have?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nAdam and Jackie have a total of 6 apples. If Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, let's say Jackie has x apples, then Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, they have 6 apples, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 4) = 6. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 6. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 2. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 1. Therefore, Jackie has 1 apple and Adam has 5 apples.

Since we can't have a negative number of students, we must have counted the student going to both twice. Therefore, we must add the number of students going to both (12 - 13 = -1) to the total number of students going to the movies or the library. Therefore, the number of students going to the movies or the library is 12 + 13 - 1 = 24. The answer is 24.",

If 3 students are chosen at random, how many different groups of 3 students can be chosen?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the number of different groups of 3 students that can be chosen, we use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of students (15) and k is the number of students in each group (3). C(15, 3) = 15! / (3!(15-3)!) = 15! / (3!12!) = (15 × 14 × 13) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 455. Therefore, there are 455 different groups of 3 students that can be chosen. The answer is 455.",

If 3 students are chosen at random, what is the probability that the 3 students chosen are all boys?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that the 3 students chosen are all boys, we divide the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 15 students (15C3) by the number of ways to choose 3 students from 15 students (15C3). Since the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 15 students is the same as the number of ways to choose 3 students from 15 students, we can set up the equation: 15C3 / 15C3 = 1. Therefore, the probability that the 3 students chosen are all boys is 1. The answer is 1.",

C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 495. Therefore, there are 495 different groups of 4 students that can be chosen. The answer is 495.",

If 5 students are chosen at random to go to the movies, what is the probability that 3 of the students are girls?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that 3 of the students are girls, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 25 students and the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 20 students. We can do this by using the combination formula: C(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * (25 - 3)!) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2300. We can also find the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 20 students: C(20, 2) = 20! / (2! * (20 - 2)!) = 20! / (2! * 18!) = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190. Now, we can find the probability that 3 of the students are girls: P(3 girls) = C(25, 3) / C(20, 2) = 2300 / 190 = 12.26. Therefore, the probability that 3 of the students are girls is 12.26%.

If 5 students are chosen at random, what is the probability that 3 of them are girls?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that 3 of the students chosen are girls, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 25 students and the number of ways to choose 5 students out of 25 students. The number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 25 students is 25C3 = 25! / (3! * (25-3)!) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2300. The number of ways to choose 5 students out of 25 students is 25C5 = 25! / (5! * (25-5)!) = 25! / (5! * 20!) = (25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 53130.

If 3 students are chosen at random, what is the probability that the 3 students chosen are all boys?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that the 3 students chosen are all boys, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 boys from the 15 boys in the class and divide it by the total number of ways to choose 3 students from the 15 students in the class. The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 15 boys is 15C3 = 455. The total number of ways to choose 3 students from 15 students is 15C3 = 455. Therefore, the probability that the 3 students chosen are all boys is 455 / 455 = 1. The answer is 1.\n\nQuestion: There are 5 students in a class. If 2 students are chosen at random, what is the probability that the 2 students chosen are both girls?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that the 2 students chosen are both girls, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the 5 girls in the class and divide it by the total number of ways to choose 2 students from the 5 students in the class. The number of ways to choose 2 girls from 5 girls is 5C2 = 10. The total number of ways to choose 2 students from 5 students is 5C2 = 10. Therefore, the probability that the 2 students chosen are both girls is 10 / 10 = 1. The answer is 1.\n\nQuestion: There are 8 students in a class. If 4 students are chosen at random, what is the probability that the 4 students chosen are all girls?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that the 4 students chosen are all girls, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 girls from the 8 girls in the class and divide it by the total number of ways to choose 4 students from the 8 students in the class. The number of ways to choose 4 girls",
