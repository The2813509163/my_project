If 5 students are chosen at random, how many different groups of 3 students can be chosen?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the number of different groups of 3 students that can be chosen, we use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) where n is the total number of students (25) and k is the number of students in each group (3). C(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * (25 - 3)!) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 25 * 24 * 23 / 6 = 2300. Therefore, there are 2300 different groups of 3 students that can be chosen.

If 5 students are chosen at random to go to the movies, what is the probability that all 5 students are girls?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that all 5 students are girls, we need to know the total number of ways to choose 5 students from the class (25C5) and the number of ways to choose 5 girls from the class (25C5). Since the number of ways to choose 5 girls from the class is the same as the number of ways to choose 5 girls from the class, we can set up the equation: 25C5 = 5C5. To find 25C5, we can use the formula: 25C5 = 25! / (5! * (25-5)!) = 25! / (5! * 20!) = (25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 53130. To find 5C5, we can use the formula: 5C5 = 5! / (5! * (5-5)!) = 5! / (5! * 0!) = 1. Therefore, the probability that all 5 students are girls is 1/53130.

Since we can't have a negative amount of sugar, we must have made a mistake. Let's recheck the problem. We know that Mary already put in 11 cups of flour. The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour. So, she needs to add 14 - 11 = 3 cups of flour. To find the number of cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we subtract the number of cups of sugar she already put in (5) from the total number of cups of sugar (5): 5 - 5 = 0. Therefore, Mary needs to add 0 cups of sugar. The answer is 0.",

What is the 5th term of the sequence?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the 5th term of the sequence, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference. We know that the 5th term (a_5) is 25, the first term (a_1) is 0, and the term number (n) is 5. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for d: 25 = 0 + (5 - 1)d. Simplifying the equation, we get 25 = 4d. Dividing both sides by 4, we get d = 25 / 4 = 6.25. Therefore, the 5th term of the sequence is 25 + (5 - 1)(6.25) = 25 + (4)(6.25) = 25 + 25 = 50.

We can do this by using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) where n is the total number of students and k is the number of students we want to choose. The number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 25 students is C(25, 3) = 25! / (3! * (25 - 3)!) = 25! / (3! * 22!) = (25 * 24 * 23) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 2300. The number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 20 students is C(20, 2) = 20! / (2! * (20 - 2)!) = 20! / (2! * 18!) = (20 * 19) / (2 * 1) = 190. The probability that 3 of the students chosen are girls is the number of ways to choose 3 girls out of 25 students divided by the number of ways to choose 2 boys out of 20 students: 2300 / 190 = 12.26.

If 4 students are chosen at random to go to the movies, what is the probability that the first student chosen is a boy?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that the first student chosen is a boy, we divide the number of boys (20) by the total number of students (20): 20 / 20 = 1. Therefore, the probability that the first student chosen is a boy is 1. The answer is 1.\n\nQuestion: There are 25 students in a class. If 5 students are chosen at random to go to the movies, what is the probability that the first student chosen is a girl?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the probability that the first student chosen is a girl, we divide the number of girls (25) by the total number of students (25): 25 / 25 = 1. Therefore, the probability that the first student chosen is a girl is 1. The",
