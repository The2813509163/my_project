The formula is: (n - 1)! / (n - n)! = 3! / (3 - 1)! / (3 - 3)! = 3! / (2)! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 * 1 = 6\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer: To find the number of ways to arrange 3 objects (A, B, and C) in a row, we use the formula (n - 1)! / (n - n)! = 3! / (2)! = 6. However, since we can't have a fraction of an arrangement, we round down to 6, but in this case, we can't have a fraction of an arrangement, so we can't have 6 ways to arrange 3 objects.

If she has 157 bottles left How many days did she drink for?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the number of days Debby drank, we divide the total number of bottles she bought (301) by the number of bottles she drank per day (144): 301 / 144 = 2.08. Since Debby can't drink a fraction of a bottle, we round down to 2 days. We also divide the number of bottles she has left (157) by the number of bottles she drank per day (144): 157 / 144 = 1.09. Since Debby can't drink a fraction of a bottle, we round down to 1 day. Therefore, Debby drank 2 days and had 157 - 2 * 144 = 157 - 288 = -131 bottles left. Since she can't have a negative number of bottles, we round up to 131 bottles. The answer is 131.\n\nQuestion: The total number of students in a school is 100.

How many people are in the town?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer: To find the number of people in the town, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the number of people in the town. Then, the number of people in the neighboring town is 2x. According to the problem, the number of people in the town is 4 times the number of people in the neighboring town, so we can set up the equation: x = 4(2x). Solving for x, we get: x = 8x, which implies 7x = 0. Therefore, x = 0. However, this is not possible since the number of people cannot be 0. Let's re-examine the problem. We can set up the equation: x = 4(2x) - 2x, which simplifies to: x = 8x - 2x, or: x = 6x. This implies 5x = 0, which is not possible. However, we can try to find the correct solution by re-examining the problem. Let's try again. We can set up the equation: x = 4(2x) - 2x, which simplifies to: x = 8x - 2x, or: x = 6x.
