Therefore, we need to rephrase the question. The correct question is: How many action figures did Jerry add to the shelf? Since there are 8 action figures on his shelf now, and he added some more action figures to the shelf, the number of action figures he added to the shelf is 8 + x, where x is the number of action figures he added. Since Jerry added some more action figures to the shelf, the number of action figures he added to the shelf is 1 more than the number of action figures he added to the shelf.
