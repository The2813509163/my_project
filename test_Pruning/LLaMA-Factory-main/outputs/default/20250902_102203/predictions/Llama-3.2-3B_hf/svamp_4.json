Since the number of students present is 1 when 2 students are absent, 2 when 1 student is absent, and 3 when 0 students are absent, we can set up the following equations: 3 - 2 = 1, 3 - 1 = 2, and 3 - 0 = 3. However, the problem states that the number of students absent is the same in all cases. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3 - x = 1, where x is the number of students absent. Solving for x, we get: 3 - x = 1 --> x = 2. Therefore, 2 students are absent. The answer is 2.\n\nQuestion: There are 3 students in the class.

        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of marbles Doug has as x.\nSince Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 19 marbles.\nNow Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 19 + 8 = x + 27 marbles.\nSince Ed lost some marbles, the number of marbles Ed lost is the difference between the number of marbles Ed had and the number of marbles Ed has now.\nSo Ed lost (x + 19) - (x + 27) = -8 marbles.\nSince Ed can't lose a negative number of marbles, this means Ed must have had 27 marbles to begin with.\nSo Doug had 27 marbles and Ed had 27 + 19 = 46 marbles.\nNow Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has 46 + 8 = 54 marbles.\nSince Ed lost some marbles, Ed must have lost 54 - 46 = 8 marbles.\nThus, Ed lost \\boxed{8} marbles.
