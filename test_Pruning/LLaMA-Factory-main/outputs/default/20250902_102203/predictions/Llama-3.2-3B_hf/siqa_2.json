        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: This question is asking why Riley left money on the counter in the kitchen and watched Jesse closely. The answer is that Riley wanted to see if she could trust Jesse. This is because Riley had been stealing money from the kitchen counter, and she wanted to make sure that Jesse would not steal from her. By leaving money on the counter and watching Jesse closely, Riley was trying to test Jesse's character. If Jesse did not steal the money, then Riley would know that she could trust Jesse, and she would be more likely to leave money on the counter in the future. If Jesse did steal the money, then Riley would know that she could not trust Jesse, and she would be more likely to leave money on the counter in the future.
