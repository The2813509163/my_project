If each mouth has 2 eyes, then the total number of eyes in the room is 1920 * 2 = 3840. If each eye has 2 ears, then the total number of ears in the room is 3840 * 2 = 7680. If each ear has 2 noses, then the total number of noses in the room is 7680 * 2 = 15360. If each nose has 2 mouths, then the total number of mouths in the room is 15360 * 2 = 30720. If each mouth has 2 eyes, then the total number of eyes in the room is 30720 * 2 = 61440. If each eye has 2 ears, then the total number of ears in the room is 61440 * 2 = 122880. If each ear has 2 noses, then the total number of noses in the room is",
