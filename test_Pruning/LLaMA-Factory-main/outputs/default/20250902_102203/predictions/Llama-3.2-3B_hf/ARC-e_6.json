The steps in the water cycle that most directly cause floods are precipitation and runoff. When precipitation falls on the ground, it can cause runoff if the ground is already saturated or if the precipitation is heavy enough to cause flooding. This is because the water cannot soak into the ground and is instead forced to move over the surface. The runoff can then cause flooding if it flows into a river or other body of water, which can overflow its banks.

        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The gravitational pull of the Moon has a direct effect on Earth by causing changes in tidal ranges. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. The Moon's gravitational pull is stronger than the Sun's, so the Moon's pull causes the tides. The Moon's pull is also responsible for the change of seasons. The Moon's gravitational pull causes the Earth to tilt on its axis, which in turn causes the seasons.

This is because the nuclei of the atoms involved in the reaction must be moving at a certain speed in order to react. The energy required to achieve this speed is called the activation energy. Once the nuclei have reached this speed, the reaction can occur. The energy released during the reaction is called the binding energy, which is the energy that holds the nuclei together. Nuclear reactions are typically classified as either fission or fusion. Fission reactions occur when a heavy nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy. Fusion reactions occur when two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy. Both types of nuclear reactions are classified as endothermic.",

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: Sound waves are caused by air vibrations. When two students standing ten feet apart talk, they can hear each other because sound waves can travel through air. The air vibrations allow them to hear each other. The correct answer is air vibrations. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe how sound waves travel through air.",
