For example, you can say that someone is clean, which is the same as saying they washed themselves. You can also use adjectives that describe a person's appearance, such as dirty or clean. The same is true for places and things. For example, you can say that a room is clean, which is the same as saying it has been washed. You can also say that a room is dirty, which is the same as saying it has not been washed. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, or B. However, the question asks how you would describe Taylor, not the room. Since the room is described as dirty, Taylor is also described as dirty. Therefore, the answer is C.",
