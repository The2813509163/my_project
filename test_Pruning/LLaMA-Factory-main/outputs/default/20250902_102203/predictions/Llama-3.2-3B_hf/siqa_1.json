An adverb generally comes before the verb it modifies. An adjective generally comes after the noun it modifies. Some adverbs act like adjectives and modify nouns as well as verbs. Here are examples of adverbs and adjectives: The adverb quickly in the sentence The boys ran quickly is an adverb, because it modifies the verb ran. The adjective quick in the sentence The boys are quick is an adjective, because it modifies the noun boys. The adverb quickly in the sentence The boys will receive quickly delivered flowers is an adverb, because it modifies the verb will receive.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: You can use adjectives to describe people, places, or things. An adjective is a word that describes a noun (a person, place, or thing). Adjectives are usually placed before the noun they describe. There are three types of adjectives: descriptive, possessive, and quantifiers. Descriptive adjectives tell you who has something, what a person is like, or what a thing is like. For example, the adjective \"big\" describes a person's size, the adjective \"red\" describes a person's hair color, and the adjective \"old\" describes a person's age. Possessive adjectives are used to describe possession. They are \"my,\" \"your,\" \"his,\" \"her,\" \"our,\" and \"their.\" Quantifiers are used to describe how many or how much of something there is. For example, the word \"many\" is a quantifier, and it tells you that there are more than one of something. The word \"much\" is also a quantifier, and it tells you that there is a lot of something. You can also use adverbs to describe people, places, or things. An adverb is a word that describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs are usually placed near the verb they describe. There are three types of adverbs: manner adverbs, frequency adverbs, and place adverbs. Manner adverbs tell you how something is done. For example, the adverb \"quickly\" tells you that something is done quickly. Frequency adverbs tell you how often something is done. For example, the adverb \"often\" tells you that something is done often. Place adverbs tell you where something is done or happens. For example, the adverb \"here\" tells you that something is done or happens here. The sentence says, \"Jordan was being loud and kept Carson up all night.\" The word \"loud\" is an adjective that describes Jordan. It tells you that Jordan was being noisy.

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: To describe someone, you need to use a verb (action word) from the present tense. The present tense describes something that happens now or always happens. For example, you can say, \"She talks\" or \"He sings.\" You can't say, \"She talksed\" or \"He sanged.\" The present tense is the basic form of a verb. There are two main parts to a present tense verb: the base form and the ending. The base form is the form of the verb that you add the ending to. The ending tells the tense (time) of the verb. For example, the base form of the verb \"to talk\" is \"talk,\" and the ending \"s\" tells us that it's in the present tense. The present tense of verbs is used to describe actions that are happening now or that have no specific time reference. The present tense is used in the simple present, present progressive (also called present continuous), present perfect, and present perfect progressive tenses. The simple present is used to describe a habit, a routine, or a general truth. The present progressive is used to describe an action that is currently in progress. The present perfect is used to describe an action that has happened at some time before now. The present perfect progressive is used to describe an action that has been going on for a certain period of time.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. The brain is the control center of the nervous system. It is located in the skull. The spinal cord is a long, thin cord of nerve tissue that extends from the brain down to the lower back. Nerves are bundles of nerve fibers that carry messages to and from the brain and spinal cord. Nerves branch out from the spinal cord and the brain to all parts of the body. The nervous system controls and coordinates all the activities of the body. It controls the heartbeat, the rate of breathing, the movement of muscles, and the secretions of glands. It also controls the senses of touch, sight, smell, taste, and hearing. The nervous system is the most complex part of the body. It is made up of billions of nerve cells, or neurons. Each neuron is a specialized cell that receives messages from other neurons, processes the messages, and sends out new messages. The nervous system is divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord. The PNS consists of nerves and ganglia. The PNS is divided into two main parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary activities, such as heartbeat, breathing, and digestion.
