How old is the youngest boy?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the age of the youngest boy, we subtract the age of the girl from the age of the youngest boy. Let's denote the age of the youngest boy as x. Then the age of the girl is x + 5. Since there are 2 boys and 1 girl, the sum of their ages is 3x. We know that the sum of the ages of the 2 boys is 2x, and the age of the girl is x + 5. Therefore, 2x = 2x + 10, which implies x = 5. Therefore, the youngest boy is 5 years old. The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion: There are 3 people in the room. If 2 of them are boys and 1 is a girl, and the girl is 5 years older than the youngest boy.
