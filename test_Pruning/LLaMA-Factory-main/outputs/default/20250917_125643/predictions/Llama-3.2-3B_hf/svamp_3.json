If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of cups of flour Mary put in as x. \nSince she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, the number of cups of sugar she put in is x - 2. \nThe total number of cups of flour she put in is 11, so x = 11. \nThe total number of cups of sugar she put in is 7, so x - 2 = 7. \nWe can now solve for x: 11 = x and 7 = x - 2. \nSince x = 11, we can now solve for x - 2: 11 = x - 2. \nAdding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get 13 = x. \nHowever, we already know that x = 11. \nTherefore, the correct answer is 11.\n\nQuestion: A group of 5 students is going to a party.

Then the number of files he deleted is 3 - x. \nWe know that Dave had 11 apps initially and 2 apps left after deleting some apps. So he deleted x apps. \nWe also know that Dave had 3 files initially and 24 files left after deleting some files. So he deleted 3 - x files. \nSince the number of apps and files he deleted are the same, we can set up the equation: x = 3 - x. \nSolving for x, we get x = 3. \nSo Dave deleted 3 apps and 3 - 3 = 0 files. \nThis means that Dave has 2 apps left and 24 files left. \nThe difference between the number of files and apps he has left is 24 - 2 = 22. \nThus, Dave has \\boxed{22} more files than apps left on the phone.
