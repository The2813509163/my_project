Abiotic factors include temperature, precipitation, soil type, and the availability of nutrients. The temperature of the water is the most important abiotic factor that limits the number of frogs living in a pond. Frogs are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. Frogs are cold-blooded, meaning they cannot generate their own heat.

When muscles are active, the body also produces more carbon dioxide as a by-product of this energy production. Nitrogen is not involved in this process. Water is not required for muscle contraction.

It is a statement of the law of conservation of mass, which states that the total mass of the reactants is equal to the total mass of the products. The balanced equation shows the number of molecules of each substance that reacts or forms. For example, the equation for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water is 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O.
