We can solve these equations to find the number of apples Adam has.\n\nFrom A + J = T, we get A = T - J. Substituting A = J + 8 into this equation gives us J + 8 = T - J, which simplifies to 2J = T - 8. Since T = 12, we have 2J = 12 - 8 = 4, so J = 2.\n\nNow that we know J = 2, we can find A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nSo Adam has 10 apples.\n\nThe answer is 10.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
