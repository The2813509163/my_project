        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The best answer is B, because the species have similar bone structure. This is the strongest evidence that two animal species evolved from a common ancestor in recent geological history. The other options are not as strong. For example, the species being herbivores does not necessarily mean that they evolved from a common ancestor. The species living in the same environment is not a strong indicator of evolution, because many species live in the same environment and do not have a common ancestor. The species obtaining oxygen from the air is also not a strong indicator of evolution, because many species obtain oxygen from the air and do not have a common ancestor.

The wolf's strategy of hunting sick or weak prey animals also reduces the likelihood of the prey animal being preyed upon by other predator species. This is because the wolf is more likely to be successful in hunting the prey animal, and the prey animal is less likely to be preyed upon by other predators.

Therefore, the polar bear exhibit should include hot, bright lights to simulate the warm, sunny days of the Arctic. The other options are not necessary for the polar bear exhibit. The food bowl with fruit is not needed, as polar bears do not eat fruit. The cold-water pool is not needed, as polar bears do not live in water. The tall palm trees are not needed, as polar bears do not live in tropical regions. The correct answer is B. Hot, bright lights.",

He was a British scientist who is known for his work in chemistry and physics. He is also known as the father of modern atomic theory. He was the first to propose the atomic theory of matter, which states that all matter is composed of atoms that are indivisible and indestructible. He also proposed the law of multiple proportions, which states that when two elements combine to form a compound, the ratio of the weights of the elements is constant. This law is still used today to determine the composition of compounds. He also proposed the law of partial pressures, which states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas in the mixture. This law is still used today to determine the composition of gases.

The increase in nonnative plants is not a likely effect of the increase in tourism and agriculture, as the increase in tourism and agriculture would likely lead to an increase in the number of native plants, not nonnative plants. The decrease in industrialization is also not a likely effect, as the increase in tourism and agriculture would likely lead to an increase in the number of industrial facilities, not a decrease. The increase in water pollution is also not a likely effect, as the increase in tourism and agriculture would likely lead to an increase in the amount of waste water, not an increase in water pollution.
