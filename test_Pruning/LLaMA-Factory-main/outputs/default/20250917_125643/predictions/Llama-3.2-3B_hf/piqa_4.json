        "prediction": " A\nExplanation:  To get rid of bags under your eyes, you need to sleep until they disappear.  This is because bags under your eyes are caused by a lack of sleep.  When you sleep, your body produces more of the hormone melatonin, which helps to reduce the appearance of bags under your eyes.  Therefore, the best way to get rid of bags under your eyes is to sleep until they disappear.  This means that you should aim to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.  If you can't get enough sleep, you may want to try using eye creams or other products that claim to reduce the appearance of bags under your eyes.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: Baking powder is a leavening agent, which means it's used to make food rise in the oven. Baking soda is also a leavening agent, but it needs to be combined with an acid to work. Pancakes typically use baking powder, but if you don't have any, you can use a combination of baking soda and an acid such as vinegar or lemon juice. However, if you only have baking soda, you can't make pancakes with it alone. You would need to use an acid to make it work. Therefore, the correct answer is: Baking powder and baking soda. You will need both to make pancakes. If you only have baking soda, you can't make pancakes. If you only have baking powder, you can make pancakes. If you have both, you can make pancakes. So, the answer is: B. To make pancakes, you will need baking powder and baking soda. You will need both to make pancakes. If you only have baking soda, you can't make pancakes.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: To solve a Rubik's cube, you need to twist the cube such that each side is full of the all different colors. This is because the cube has 6 faces, and each face has 9 squares, so there are a total of 54 squares on the cube. To solve the cube, you need to twist the cube such that each side has 9 different colors. This is because if each side has only 8 different colors, then there will be at least one square on each side that is the same color as another square on the same side. This would mean that the cube is not fully solved, and you would need to twist the cube again to solve it.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation:  The permanent marker is a type of ink that is designed to last a long time.  It is usually made of a special type of ink that is resistant to water and other solvents.  However, there are some ways to remove it from a surface.\n\nOne way to remove permanent marker from a surface is to use a solvent.  There are many different solvents that can be used, but one of the most effective is WD40.
