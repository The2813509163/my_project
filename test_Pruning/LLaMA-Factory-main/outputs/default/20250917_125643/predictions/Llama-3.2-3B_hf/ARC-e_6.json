        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: Seafloor spreading is the process by which the Earth's crust spreads apart over time, creating new oceanic crust and making old oceanic crust move away from the spreading center. This process is driven by convection in the mantle, which causes the mantle to rise and cool, causing the crust to spread apart. Seafloor spreading is the primary mechanism for the creation of new oceanic crust and the movement of crustal plates. It is also responsible for the formation of mid-ocean ridges, which are the sites of new oceanic crust formation. Seafloor spreading is a key component of plate tectonics, which is the theory that explains the movement of crustal plates on the surface of the Earth.

The Moon's gravitational pull causes the tides to rise and fall twice a day, while the Sun's gravitational pull causes the tides to rise and fall three times a day. The Moon's gravitational pull is stronger than the Sun's, so the tides caused by the Moon are larger and more frequent. The changes in tidal ranges are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: Sound waves are caused by air vibrations. When two students standing ten feet apart talk, the sound waves from their voices travel through the air and reach the other student. The sound waves allow the other student to hear the first student's voice. Therefore, the answer is air vibrations. The correct answer is A.",
