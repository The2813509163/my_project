This is because the nervous system is made up of neurons, which are specialized cells that send electrical signals to other neurons and to the muscles of the body.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: An electromagnet is made by coiling a conductor (usually a wire) around a core of ferromagnetic material (such as iron). The core is called the \"magnet\" and the conductor is called the \"coil\". The coil is connected to a battery or other source of electric current, which produces a magnetic field around the coil. The magnetic field is strongest at the center of the coil and weakest at the edges. The strength of the magnetic field is determined by the number of turns of the coil and the current flowing through it. The magnetic field can be used to attract or repel objects made of ferromagnetic material, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt. The magnetic field can also be used to levitate objects, such as small balls, in mid-air. The magnetic field can be used to create a force that can be used to lift objects, such as cars and trucks, off the ground. The magnetic field can also be used to create a force that can be used to propel objects, such as rockets and spacecraft, through space.
