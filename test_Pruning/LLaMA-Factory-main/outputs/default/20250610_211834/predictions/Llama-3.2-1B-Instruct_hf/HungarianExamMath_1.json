        "prediction": "The volume of the resulting solid can be calculated by finding the volume of the original hexagon and then subtracting the volume of the two right circular cones that are formed by rotating the hexagon around the perpendicular bisector of side $AB$.\n\nThe original hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length 5 cm. The area of each triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 5^2 = \\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ square cm.\n\nThe volume of the original hexagon is six times the area of one triangle, which is $6 \\cdot \\frac{25\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{75\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ cubic cm.\n\nThe two right circular cones have radii of 5 cm and 2.5 cm (half the side length of the hexagon), and their heights are 5 cm. The volume of each cone is $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi (5)^2 (5) = \\frac{125\\pi}{3}$ cubic cm.\n\nThe total volume of the two cones is $2 \\cdot \\frac{125\\pi}{3} = \\frac{250\\pi}{3}$ cubic cm.\n\nThe volume of the resulting solid is the volume of the original hexagon minus the volume of the two cones, which is $\\frac{75\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{250\\pi}{3}$ cubic cm.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{75\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{250\\pi}{3}}$."
