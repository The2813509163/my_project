This incident was a stressful and potentially embarrassing experience for Kai, and it's likely that he felt a sense of relief and catharsis after sharing the story with Kendall.\n\nThe phrase \"like they got something off their chest\" is a common idiomatic expression that means that someone has finally expressed a long-held secret or emotion, often in a dramatic or intense way. In this case, Kai's experience in the lake accident was a significant event that required him to confront his emotions and share them with Kendall, which is why he felt a sense of relief and catharsis.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",

The options are:\n\nA. wanted to be helpful\nB. wanted to Jan to be glad\nC. frame the picture\n\nThe correct answer is not explicitly stated in the question, but based on the context, it seems that Jan is likely to want to do something that will make Kai happy or pleased. Since Kai improved Jan's picture, it's likely that Jan will want to do something that will make Kai happy or pleased, such as helping Jan with something or being glad for Kai's improvement.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't provide enough information to determine what Jan will want to do next.

The correct answer is that Aubrey did this so that people don't drive to fast. This is a common reason for pulling over someone who is speeding, as it is a way to remind them to slow down and be more careful on the road.\n\nThe other options are not correct.
