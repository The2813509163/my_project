As it rises, the air molecules around it exert an upward force on the ball due to their mass. This force is what keeps the ball in the air. When the ball comes back down, the same force of gravity pulls it back down, causing it to land on the ground.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. The wind pushing on the ball with friction is not a reason why the ball comes back to the ground.\n\nC. The core of Earth pulling on the ball with a magnetic attraction is not a real force.\n\nD.
