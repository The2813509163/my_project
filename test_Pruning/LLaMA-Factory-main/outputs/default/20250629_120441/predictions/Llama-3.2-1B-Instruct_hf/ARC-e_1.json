One of the key components of the immune system is the production of antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to specific pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances. When an antibody binds to a pathogen, it helps to neutralize or remove the pathogen from the body.\n\nAntibodies are produced by B cells, which are a type of immune cell.

The composition of the string (D) is also not directly responsible, as the composition of the string is what determines its tension and length, but it is not the cause of the vibrations.\n\nTherefore, the vibrations of the string (B) are the most responsible for the generation of sound waves from Bruce's violin.\n\nAnswer: B",

The correct answer is that glucose-specific enzymes must catalyze a chemical reaction with the glucose.\n\nGlucose-specific enzymes are responsible for converting glucose into energy for the cell.
