Teeth chewing food - This is a mechanical process, not a chemical change. It involves physical breakdown of food, but it's not a chemical reaction.\n\nB. Enzymes breaking down food - This is also a mechanical process, not a chemical change. Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions, but they don't change the chemical composition of food.\n\nC. Food moving through the intestines - This is a physical process, not a chemical change. The movement of food through the intestines is driven by the physical forces of digestion, but it doesn't involve a chemical reaction.\n\nD. Food churning in the stomach - This is a chemical change. The stomach secretes digestive enzymes that break down food into smaller molecules, and the stomach lining secretes mucus to protect itself from the acidic environment. This process involves a chemical reaction between the stomach's digestive enzymes and the food, resulting in a change in the chemical composition of the food.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]",

This is because the similarity in skeletal structures is often a result of convergent evolution, where different species have evolved similar traits in response to similar environmental pressures.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true.
