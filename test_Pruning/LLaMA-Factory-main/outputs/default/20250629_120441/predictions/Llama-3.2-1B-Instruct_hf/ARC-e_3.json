This process is known as latent heat of fusion. The more energy required to melt the ice, the more heat energy is released when the ice melts. In this case, the tea's freezing point increases, which means that the ice cubes will melt more slowly when the tea is hot. This is why ice cubes will melt in a glass of tea.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The tea becomes saturated is not a relevant factor in this scenario.\n\nB. The ice cubes gain energy is not a correct statement. The ice cubes are losing energy as they melt.\n\nC. The tea's freezing point increases is not a correct statement.
