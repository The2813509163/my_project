        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The safest place for a baby to sleep is in a crib or bassinet in the same room as the parents, but not in the same bed. This is because babies are at a higher risk of suffocation or strangulation when they sleep in the same bed as an adult. The safest way to sleep with your baby in the same room is to put the baby in a crib or bassinet next to the bed, and to keep the other parent out of the room until the baby is asleep. This way, the baby is less likely to roll off the bed or fall out of the crib. If you must sleep with your baby in the same bed, you should put a barrier between the baby and the other parent, such as a baby gate or a crib with a side rail. You should also keep the other parent out of the room until the baby is asleep. If you must sleep with your baby in the same bed, you should also make sure that the baby is not in a position where they can suffocate or strangle. This means that the baby should not be lying on their back, and the other parent should not be lying on top of the baby. Instead, the baby should be lying on their side, with a pillow between them and the other parent. This way, the baby is less likely to suffocate or strangle. If you must sleep with your baby in the same bed, you should also make sure that the baby is not in a position where they can fall off the bed. This means that the baby should not be lying on the edge of the bed, and the other parent should not be leaning over the baby. Instead, the baby should be lying on the bed, with a pillow between them and the other parent. This way, the baby is less likely to fall off the bed.

Put the cap back on for an hour and the marker will be good as new\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: When a marker is dry, the ink inside the marker is not flowing freely. This is because the ink is not being dissolved by the solvent (the liquid inside the marker). When you put the tip of the marker in rubbing alcohol, the rubbing alcohol dissolves the ink inside the marker. This allows the ink to flow freely again, and the marker is restored to its original condition. The time it takes for the ink to flow freely again is called the \"flash time\" of the marker. The flash time of a marker is the amount of time it takes for the ink to flow freely again after the tip of the marker is put in rubbing alcohol. The flash time of a marker is usually between 1 and 2 minutes. However, if the marker is very dry, it may take longer for the ink to flow freely again. In this case, you may need to put the tip of the marker in rubbing alcohol for a longer period of time. Therefore, the correct answer is that you need to put the cap back on for an hour.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation:  To cure hiccups, you need to find the cause of the hiccup.  There are a few ways to do this.  One way is to hold your breath, then swallow 3 times.  This is because when you hold your breath, the pressure in your chest goes down, and when you swallow, the pressure in your chest goes up.  This can make the hiccup stop.  Another way to cure hiccups is to drink a glass of water.  This is because when you drink water, the pressure in your chest goes down, and the hiccup stops.  You can also try to cure hiccups by drinking a glass of milk.  This is because milk contains a protein called casein, which can help to stop hiccups.  Finally, you can try to cure hiccups by drinking a glass of lemonade.  This is because lemonade contains a substance called citric acid, which can help to stop hiccups.  So, the answer is:  A. Hold your breath, then swallow 3 times.  B. Hold your remote, then swallow 3 times.  C. Hold your breath, then drink a glass of water.  D. Hold your breath, then drink a glass of milk.  E.
