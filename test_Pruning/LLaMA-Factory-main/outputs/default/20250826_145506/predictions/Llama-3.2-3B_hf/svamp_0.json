However, the number of wrappers cannot be negative. This means that Danny must have had 30 - 57 = -27 wrappers at first, but since he can't have a negative number of wrappers, we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's think about it: Danny found 30 wrappers at the park and now he has 57 wrappers. This means that he must have lost some wrappers. To find the number of wrappers he lost, we subtract the number of wrappers he has now (57) from the number of wrappers he found (30): 30 - 57 = -27. Again, this is not possible. However, we can try to find the number of wrappers Danny had at first by adding the number of wrappers he has now (57) to the number of wrappers he lost (30 - 57 = -27). This would give us the number of wrappers Danny had at first: 57 + (-27) = 30. However, this is still not correct. Let's think about it: Danny found 30 wrappers at the park and now he has 57 wrappers. This means that he must have lost some wrappers, but he also must have gained some wrappers.
