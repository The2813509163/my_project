        "origin_prompt": "To fully cook the mac and cheese in the oven\nA. bake at  428 degrees F for 20 - 25 minutes\nB. bake at  428 degrees C for 20 - 25 minutes\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A\nExplanation:  To determine the temperature at which to bake the mac and cheese, we need to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, since the answer choices are in degrees Fahrenheit. We use the formula: (°F - 32) / 1.8 = °C. Plugging in the value of 428, we get: (428 - 32) / 1.8 = 396 / 1.8 = 220.00. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 220. So, the answer is 220. To convert this to degrees Fahrenheit, we multiply by 1.8: 220 * 1.8 = 396. So, the answer is 396. The final answer is: \\boxed{428}. Note that the question asks to bake at 428 degrees F for 20 - 25 minutes, but the answer is 428 degrees F. This is because the question asks to bake at 428 degrees F, and the answer is 428 degrees F. The question does not ask to convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit, so we can leave the answer as 428 degrees F. However, since the answer choices are in degrees Fahrenheit, we can convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit by multiplying by 1.8: 428 * 1.8 = 776. So, the answer is 776. But the question asks to bake at 428 degrees F for 20 - 25 minutes, so we can leave the answer as 428 degrees F. The final answer is: 428.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: When metal is hot, it expands. This means that the metal will be larger in volume than it would be if it were cold. This is because the atoms in the metal are moving faster when the metal is hot, which means that they are taking up more space. When the metal cools down, it will shrink back to its original size. This is because the atoms in the metal will slow down, which means that they will take up less space. So, to make seat belt metal cool on a hot day, you should spray the metal with a water mist.
