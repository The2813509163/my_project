        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The main mode of transportation for goods is by sea. This is because it is the most efficient way to transport goods over long distances. It is also the most cost-effective way to transport goods. The main reason for this is that it is the most efficient way to use the available space on a ship. This is because ships are designed to carry goods, and they are not designed to carry people. Therefore, the most efficient way to transport goods is by sea. This is why many island nations have developed advanced technology for transporting goods by sea. This technology is known as shipping. Shipping is the process of transporting goods by sea.

        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The atomic number of an atom is the number of protons in its nucleus. Since the atomic number is 20, the atom has 20 protons. The sum of the number of protons and neutrons is 20. The sum of the number of protons and electrons is not 20. The number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, so the sum of the number of protons and electrons is equal to twice the atomic number. Therefore, the sum of the number of protons and electrons is 2 x 20 = 40. The number of neutrons in an atom is not equal to the atomic number. The number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons minus the number of electrons. Since the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons, the number of neutrons is equal to zero. Therefore, the sum of the number of protons and neutrons is 20. The answer is D. The sum of the number of protons and neutrons is 20. The sum of the number of protons and electrons is not 20.

        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The rainforest is a complex ecosystem that is home to many different species of plants and animals. When scientists develop a new medication from a plant that is part of the rainforest food chain, they may be concerned about the impact on the rainforest wildlife. The plant may be a food source for some animals, and if the plant is removed, the animals may not have enough to eat. This could lead to a decrease in the number of animals in the rainforest, which could have a negative impact on the ecosystem. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
