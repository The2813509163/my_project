During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nTo find the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt, we need to first calculate the total amount of money made from selling jerseys and t-shirts. \nThe total amount of money made from selling jerseys is $115 * 78 = 9000. \nThe total amount of money made from selling t-shirts is $25 * 113 = 2835. \nThe total amount of money made from selling both jerseys and t-shirts is $9000 + 2835 = 11835. \nNow we can calculate the difference in cost between a jersey and a t-shirt by subtracting the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey. \nThe difference in cost is $115 - 25 = 90. \nThus, a jersey costs \\boxed{90} dollars more than a t-shirt.

How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden as x.\nWe know that Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut x roses from her garden.\nSo the total number of roses she threw away is 34 + x.\nWe also know that there are 21 roses in the vase initially and 15 roses in the vase now.\nSo the total number of roses Jessica threw away is 21 - 15 = 6.\nThus, 34 + x = 6.\nThis implies that x = -28.\nSince x cannot be negative, we will assume that Jessica cut 28 roses from her garden and threw away 6 roses from the vase.\nSo the number of roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden is 6 - 28 = -22.\nHowever, since the number of roses cannot be negative, we will assume that Jessica threw away 22 roses from the vase and cut 28 roses from her garden.\nSo the number of roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden is 22 - 28 = -6.\nThus, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than those she cut from her garden.\nThe answer is \\boxed{-6}.
