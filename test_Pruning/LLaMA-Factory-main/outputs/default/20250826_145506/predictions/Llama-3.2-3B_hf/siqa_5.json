This is a good thing, because it helps us to protect ourselves from danger. However, if we don't express our anger in a healthy way, it can lead to problems, such as anger management issues, depression, or even violence. So, it's important to learn how to express our anger in a healthy way, such as by talking to someone we trust or by writing down our feelings. This will help us to release pressure and feel better.",
