Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of children that got on the bus as x.\nThen the number of children that got off the bus is 36 - x.\nThe total number of children on the bus after some got off and some got on is 36 + x - (36 - x) = 12.\nThis implies that x = 12.\nSo the number of children that got off the bus is 36 - x = 36 - 12 = 24.\nThe number of children that got on the bus is 12.\nSo the number of children that got off the bus is 24 and the number of children that got on the bus is 12.\nThe difference between the number of children that got off the bus and those that got on is 24 - 12 = 12.\nThus, \\boxed{12} more children got off the bus than those that got on.

How many boys are there in total?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nLet's denote the number of boys as x.\nThen the number of girls is x - 2.\nWe know that the total number of children is 3.\nSo x + (x - 2) = 3.\nThis implies that 2x - 2 = 3.\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get 2x = 5.\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2.5.\nSince x must be an integer, this is a problem.\nHowever, we can see that x = 2 satisfies the equation 2x - 2 = 3.\nSo there are 2 boys and 1 girl.\nThus, the total number of boys is 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe answer is 3.\n\nQuestion: A man has 3 children.

        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as x. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 2 marbles. We know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation x + 2 = x + 19. Solving for x, we get 2 = 19, which is not possible. However, we can also set up the equation x + 2 = x + 19 - 2x, which simplifies to 2 = 17 - 2x. Solving for x, we get 2x = 15, so x = 7.5. However, the number of marbles must be an integer, so we can try x = 7 and x = 8. If x = 7, then Ed has 9 marbles and Doug has 5 marbles. If x = 8, then Ed has 10 marbles and Doug has 6 marbles. Since Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, the only possible solution is x = 8. Therefore, Doug lost 6 marbles.\n\nQuestion: A group of 5 friends went to a restaurant.
