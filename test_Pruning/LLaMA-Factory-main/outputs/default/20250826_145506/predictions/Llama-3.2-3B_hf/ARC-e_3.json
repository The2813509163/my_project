        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: A species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring. This means that all the members of the species can mate with each other and produce offspring that are similar in appearance. The offspring will also be able to breed and produce fertile offspring. This is known as the ability to reproduce asexually or sexually. The ability to reproduce asexually is known as clonal reproduction. The ability to reproduce sexually is known as sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of two gametes (sperm and egg) to produce a zygote. The zygote will then develop into an embryo, which will eventually become an adult. The adult will then reproduce sexually or asexually to produce more offspring. The offspring will then reproduce sexually or asexually to produce more offspring, and so on.

An atom is the smallest unit of an element that can be isolated from it and still retain all of its chemical properties. An atom is made up of three types of particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number, which is the number that identifies each element. The number of neutrons in an atom determines its mass number, which is the number that identifies each isotope of an element. The number of electrons in an atom determines its charge, which is either positive or negative. The number of electrons in an atom also determines its chemical properties.

They also produce urine, which is the waste product of the body. The kidneys are located in the middle of the back, one on each side of the spine, and are about the size of a fist. The kidneys are made up of millions of tiny units called nephrons. Each nephron has a ball-shaped structure called the glomerulus, which filters the blood. The glomerulus is surrounded by a cup-shaped structure called the Bowman's capsule, which collects the filtered blood. The filtered blood then passes into the nephron, where it is filtered again. The filtered blood then passes into the collecting duct, where it is collected and sent to the bladder. The kidneys also produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the production of red blood cells. The kidneys also produce a hormone called renin, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure.

When a mineral is scratched across the surface of the streak plate, the mineral leaves a mark that is called a streak. The streak is a characteristic of the mineral and can be used to identify it. The streak plate is also used to determine the hardness of a mineral, but this is not the primary purpose of the streak plate. The streak plate is not used to determine the structure of a mineral or the luster of a mineral. Ref: 25th edition, Mineralogy, 2nd edition, by Robert V. Dietrich, page 3.",

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: When heat is added to water, the energy of motion of the water molecules increases. This is because the molecules have more energy to move around. The energy of motion of the water molecules is increased, which means that the water molecules have more energy to move around. This is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect. Adding ice to water will not increase the energy of motion of the water molecules. Removing some of the water will not increase the energy of motion of the water molecules. Placing the water in the freezer will not increase the energy of motion of the water molecules.",

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: Thermal properties are the properties of a material that determine how it responds to heating and cooling. Thermal properties include the specific heat, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion. The specific heat of a material is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of the material by 1 degree Celsius. Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat. Thermal expansion is the change in volume of a material as its temperature changes. The thermal properties of a material are determined by its atomic structure and the way its atoms are arranged. The specific heat of a material is determined by the number of atoms in the material and the way they are arranged. The thermal conductivity of a material is determined by the number of atoms in the material and the way they are arranged. The thermal expansion of a material is determined by the number of atoms in the material and the way they are arranged. The thermal properties of a material are important in determining how it responds to heating and cooling. For example, the specific heat of a material determines how much heat is required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of the material by 1 degree Celsius. The thermal conductivity of a material determines how easily heat can be conducted through the material. The thermal expansion of a material determines how much the volume of the material changes as its temperature changes. The thermal properties of a material are important in determining how it responds to heating and cooling. Therefore, the answer is C.",

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: Rabies is a viral infection that affects the nervous system. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected animal. The virus enters the body through the skin and then travels to the central nervous system, where it causes inflammation and damage to the brain and spinal cord. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, the virus can cause paralysis and death. There is no cure for rabies, and treatment consists of supportive care and prevention of further spread of the virus. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent rabies, and it is recommended for all people who may be at risk of exposure to the virus.
