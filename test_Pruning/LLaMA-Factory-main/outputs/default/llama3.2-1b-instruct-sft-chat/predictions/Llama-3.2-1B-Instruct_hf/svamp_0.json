Therefore, Paul lost 20 crayons. To find the number of crayons he gave away, we subtract the number of crayons he lost (20) from the total number of crayons he had (110): 110 - 20 = 90. Paul gave away 90 crayons. To find the difference, we subtract the number of crayons he gave away (90) from the number of crayons he lost (20): 20 - 90 = -70. However, the question asks how many more crayons he lost than those he gave to his friends, so we take the absolute value of the difference: |-70| = 70. Therefore, Paul lost 70 more crayons than those he gave to his friends. The answer is 70.",

We are told that together they have 14 apples, so 2x + 4 = 14. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 2x = 10. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 5.

We know they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and a total of 186 t-shirts during both games. So, the total number of t-shirts sold is 172 + 186 = 358. Since they make $78 off each t-shirt, the total amount of money they made is 358 * 78 = 27716. Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $27716 from selling t-shirts during the Texas tech game.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question as it asks for the amount of money left after Dan spent money, but the calculation results in a negative amount, indicating a loss. However, following the calculation: 4 - 8 - 5 = -9, we can say that Dan has a loss of $9. Since the question likely intends to ask for the amount of money left after Dan spent money, the answer would be a negative number, but to follow the format, we'll provide the absolute value of the result, which is 9.
