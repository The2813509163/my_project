        "origin_prompt": "Remy left school on account of their live being a total mess that needs to be figured out.\nQuestion: How would you describe Remy?\nA. are headstrong\nB. frustrated\nC. upset\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: To figure out the meaning of a word, you need to figure out what kind of thing it is. If the word is a noun, you need to figure out who or what the noun is about. If the word is a verb, you need to figure out what kind of action it describes. You can do this by using the dictionary, by realizing how the word is used in a sentence, or by figuring out the word's part of speech by using a tool like WordPilot. Once you know what kind of thing the word is, you can describe the word in terms of that thing. For example, if the word is a noun and it describes a person, you can say that the word is a name. If the word is a verb and it describes an action, you can say that the word is a type of action. This is called a definition. Definitions are especially useful when you are writing a sentence and you need more information about a word. For example, suppose you were writing a story and you wanted to say that the character Remy was upset. You might say that Remy was upset because their live was a total mess that needed to be figured out. In this sentence, you provided a reason for why Remy was upset, which is that their live was a total mess. This is a good example of how to describe a word, because it tells you what kind of thing the word is (a noun) and it tells you what kind of thing the word describes (a live). The word \"live\" is a noun that describes a person's life. So, you could describe Remy as being frustrated because their live was a total mess that needed to be figured out. This is because \"frustrated\" is a verb that describes an action (being frustrated) and \"live\" is a noun that describes a person's life.",

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The words that describe how someone feels are often adjectives. We can use adjectives to describe how we feel, how a character feels in a story, or how a place looks. Adjectives can be describing words or attribute words. Describing words tell us more about a person, animal, place, object, or action. Attribute words tell us more about the quantity or nature of a person, animal, place, object, or action. Some words can be both describing words and attribute words. We can determine whether or not a word is an adjective by using the rules of syntax, which are the rules about how words are used in a sentence. In a sentence, an adjective generally comes before the noun it describes. Sometimes an adjective comes after a verb, but this is not a general rule. In a sentence, an adjective usually comes before the noun: my beautiful girl. In this sentence, beautiful is an adjective that describes the girl. In a sentence, an attribute word generally comes after a noun or pronoun: I have a lot of money. In this sentence, a lot is an attribute word that tells us how much money I have. We can use this information to determine whether or not a word is an adjective. If a word comes before the noun it describes, it is an adjective. If a word comes after a noun or pronoun, it is an attribute word. The answer choices are describing words. We can determine whether or not a word is an adjective by using the rules of syntax. In a sentence, an adjective generally comes before the noun it describes. Sometimes an adjective comes after a verb, but this is not a general rule. In a sentence, an adjective usually comes before the noun: my beautiful girl. In this sentence, beautiful is an adjective that describes the girl. In a sentence, an attribute word generally comes after a noun or pronoun: I have a lot of money. In this sentence, a lot is an attribute word that tells us how much money I have. We can use this information to determine whether or not a word is an adjective. If a word comes before the noun it describes, it is an adjective. If a word comes after a noun or pronoun, it is an attribute word. The word light headed comes before the noun it describes, so it is an adjective. The word patient comes after the noun it describes, so it is an attribute word. The word foolish comes before the noun it describes, so it is an adjective. The word patient is",

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: To describe a person, you can use action verbs (such as \"ran,\" \"jumped,\" \"cried,\" and \"sang\") or adjectives (such as \"happy,\" \"helpful,\" \"quiet,\" and \"beautiful\"). The words you use to describe a person can give you a sense of the person's character. For example, if someone is described as \"helpful,\" you might think of that person as kind and caring. If someone is described as \"rebellious,\" you might think of that person as a troublemaker. The words you use to describe a person can also give you a sense of the person's personality. For example, if someone is described as \"friendly\" and \"outgoing,\" you might think of that person as outgoing and friendly. If someone is described as \"serious\" and \"quiet,\" you might think of that person as serious and quiet. However, the question asks how you would describe Jordan, not what you would describe Jordan. Since the question asks how you would describe Jordan, the answer should be a description of Jordan's character or personality. The description of Jordan's character or personality should be based on the information in the question. The question states that Jordan is a kind and caring teacher. Therefore, the correct answer is a description of Jordan's character or personality, which is kind and caring. The correct answer is B. A kind and caring teacher.",
