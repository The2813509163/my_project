The answer choices are: A. wanted to be nice to Ash B. wanted to impress them C. turn them against Ash We can rule out answer choices A and B because they don't make sense in the context of the question. If Jordan wanted to be nice to Ash, he would have done something nice for Ash, not something mean.

(action verb)\nShe is hard-working. (describing words)\nShe is a teacher who is hard-working. (subject and verb)\n\nShe is a teacher. (action verb)\nShe is intelligent. (describing words)\nShe is a teacher who is intelligent. (subject and verb)\n\nShe is a teacher. (action verb)\nShe is intelligent, but she is also hard-working. (describing words)\nShe is a teacher who is intelligent and hard-working.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: To describe someone, you can use action verbs, which are usually in the present tense. You can also use linking verbs, which are usually in the present participle form (for example, \"being\" or \"having\"). The person or thing described is usually the object of the verb or the word after the linking verb. The words \"describe\" and \"describe someone\" are both transitive verbs, so they both take a direct object. However, \"describe\" is a verb that is used to describe someone, while \"describe someone\" is a phrase that is used to describe someone. Therefore, the correct answer is \"A.\" Jordan was no longer nervous, which means that he was confident. The phrase \"no longer nervous\" is the present participle form of the verb \"nervous,\" and it describes Jordan. The phrase \"confident\" is the present participle form of the verb \"confident,\" and it describes Jordan. The phrase \"felt better about doing public speaking\" is not a present participle, so it is not a correct answer. The phrase \"agitated\" is not a present participle, so it is not a correct answer. The phrase \"felt better about doing public speaking\" is not a present participle, so it is not a correct answer. The phrase \"agitated\" is not a present participle, so it is not a correct answer.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: To describe someone, you can use action verbs (like ran, jumped, or swam) or adjective clauses (like a girl who was running, a boy who was jumping, or a man who was swimming). These phrases tell you how the person was moving or being. You can also use a single adjective to describe a person's appearance or a trait. The words you choose can give the reader a clear picture of the person's actions, appearance, or personality. For example, if you tell someone that they are \"running\" or \"jumping,\" you can give the reader a sense of how they are moving. If you say that someone is \"tall,\" \"happy,\" or \"helpful,\" you can give the reader a sense of their appearance or a trait. The words you choose to describe someone can have a big effect on the reader's impression of that person. For example, if you tell someone that they are \"running\" and then \"out of breath,\" you can give the reader a sense of how tired they are. If you say that someone is \"tall\" and then \"wearing a hat,\" you can give the reader a sense of their appearance.
