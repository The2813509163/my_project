        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: When you read a story, you can learn a lot about the characters by using what you know about the people in your own life. In this case, you can use your knowledge of body language to help you figure out how to describe Cameron. Body language is a type of nonverbal communication, which means it doesn't involve words. It includes things like eye contact, facial expressions, and posture. When you're talking to someone, you can often tell how they're feeling by looking at their body language. For example, if someone is standing with their hands on their hips, they might be angry. If they're leaning back in their chair, they might be bored. And if they're sitting up straight with their hands in their lap, they might be feeling proud. So, when you're reading a story, you can use what you know about body language to figure out how to describe a character. In this case, you can use Cameron's body language to help you figure out how to describe him. Since Cameron is standing with his hands on his hips and his face is red, you can conclude that he is feeling proud. Therefore, you can describe Cameron as humble and not too proud.

For example, you might say, \"I would describe the new building as being very modern.\" In this case, the word describe is used as a verb, meaning to give a description of someone or something. However, it can also be used as an adjective, meaning to be a certain way. For example, you might say, \"The new building is described as being very modern.\" In this case, the word describe is used as an adjective, meaning to be a certain way.

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: To describe someone, you can use action verbs (like ran, jumped, or swam) or adjective clauses (like a girl who was hungry or a man who was wearing a hat). These are often known as action verbs and adjective clauses, respectively. The verbs are usually in the present tense, and the clauses are usually nonessential. This example describes Kendall: She lost her shirt and walked around topless. This is an example of an adjective clause. The adjective clause describes Kendall, and it tells us how she was dressed. The verb in the clause is walked, which is in the present tense. The clause is nonessential because it doesn't give us any new information about Kendall. The answer is C, because Kendall is in trouble. The description of Kendall is not a direct statement of her feelings, but rather a description of her actions. The description is not a statement of her feelings, but rather a statement of her actions. The description is not a statement of her feelings, but rather a statement of her actions.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: When you read a story with pictures, you can figure out many of the words that are missing just by using what you see and what you know about the world. Many words can be figured out because they are common words that are used often in stories. You can also use pictures of people and objects to help you determine many of the words that are missing. Words that cannot be figured out easily in this way are marked with an asterisk (*) in the word list. These words are called unknown words. If you see an unknown word in a story, you can try to figure out what it means by using context clues, which are words and information in the story that help you understand the meaning of an unknown word. For example, if you see the word jump, you can use the fact that the character is swinging on a rope to help you figure out what kind of jump the character is going to make. If you see the word hot, you can use the fact that the character is wearing a jacket to help you figure out that the jacket is hot. If you see the word tree, you can use the fact that the character is sitting under a tree to help you figure out that the tree is a big tree. If you see the word river, you can use the fact that the character is standing on the riverbank to help you figure out that the river is a big river. If you see the word car, you can use the fact that the character is driving a car to help you figure out that the car is a big car. If you see the word house, you can use the fact that the character is standing in front of a house to help you figure out that the house is a big house. If you see the word boy, you can use the fact that the character is wearing a hat to help you figure out that the boy is a big boy. If you see the word girl, you can use the fact that the character is wearing a hat to help you figure out that the girl is a big girl.

You can describe a person in terms of their appearance, their personality, their values, their attitudes, and so on. The words you use can be positive or negative.

It is a great tool that you can use to find the right word or phrase to describe someone. This question is asking you to describe Skylar based on the information that she has a cavity. A cavity is a hole in a tooth that is caused by bacteria. This information is negative, so you would use a negative word to describe Skylar. The word that best describes Skylar is \"has a sweet tooth.\" This means that Skylar likes to eat sweets and chocolate. However, this information is not relevant to the question, so you should not use it to describe Skylar. Instead, you should use the information that she has a cavity.

Instead, you should use the word \"has a cavity.\" This is a negative word that describes Skylar's dental health. Therefore, the answer is not \"has a sweet tooth,\" but rather \"has a cavity.\" However, the question is asking you to describe Skylar, not to describe her dental health. Therefore, you should use the word \"has a sweet tooth\" as the answer, but this is not correct.

Since the question asks how the others would feel as a result of Alex growing closer to their cousin, the answer must be one of these two options.
