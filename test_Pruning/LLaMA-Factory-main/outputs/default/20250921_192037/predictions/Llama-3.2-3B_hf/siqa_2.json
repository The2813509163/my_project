If the sentence ends with a finite verb (a word that is not a gerund and does not end in -ing), the sentence is usually finished. For example, \"I love reading\" is a finite verb, so the sentence is finished.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: When someone behaves very stupidly, it is often appropriate to make a deprecating comment. A deprecating comment is a comment that makes fun of someone. This is because the person behaved very stupidly, and it is not appropriate to be friendly to them.

For example, it is not likely that Alex would be friendly to the person, because they behaved very stupidly.

This is a good example of a passive situation. A passive situation is a situation where someone or something is affected by another person or thing, but the person or thing that is affected is not the one that is doing the action.

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: When you read a story, you can use what you know about language and what you've learned in your daily life to figure out the meaning of words, phrases, or sentences. You can also use what you know about the people, events, or places in the story. Let's say you're reading a story and you come to a sentence that you don't understand. You can use the words in the sentence to help you figure out the meaning. For example, if you see the word \"nervous,\" you can make an educated guess as to what the person in the story is feeling—maybe they're feeling nervous because they're about to do something scary. If you see the word \"ing,\" you can figure out that the action is in progress—maybe the person is still doing something or is about to do something. If you see the word \"alone,\" you can make an educated guess as to how the person is feeling or what they're thinking—maybe they're feeling lonely or maybe they're worried because they're alone. Now, let's look at this sentence: Robin left Tracy's home late at night and began the long walk home. You can use what you know about language to figure out the meaning of this sentence. The word \"began\" tells you that Robin started the walk. The word \"home\" tells you that Robin's destination is home. The word \"late\" tells you that Robin left Tracy's home at an unusual time of night. The word \"long\" tells you that the walk is a long one. So, you can figure out that Robin is walking home alone in the dark, which would make Robin feel nervous. But wait! There's another possibility. The word \"began\" tells you that Robin started the walk, but it doesn't tell you that Robin is still walking. In fact, the word \"began\" can mean that Robin has already finished the walk. So, you can figure out that Robin has already finished the long walk home and is now back home, which would make Robin feel eager to get home. Therefore, the answer is not A, B, or C. The answer is D, but since there is no option D, we can choose the closest answer, which is C. So, the answer is C. Robin would feel eager to get home. Now it's your turn! Look at this sentence: The children were playing in the park. What is the most likely feeling of the children? Choose the answer that best matches",

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: To describe someone, you can use action verbs (like ran, jumped, or swam) or adjectives (like tall, beautiful, or happy). The words you use can give you a sense of who the person is. For example, if someone is tall and runs fast, you might describe them as athletic. If someone is happy and friendly, you might describe them as nice. Adjectives are words that describe a person, place, or thing. Some of the most common adjectives are: big, small, tall, short, happy, sad, beautiful, ugly, hungry, full, and red. You can use adjectives to describe people, places, things, and actions. Adjectives are usually preceded by the article a or the (if it's the first or second word of the sentence), and they are often followed by a noun or a clause. For example, I like a big dog. I like the dog that's big. Adjectives can be positive or negative. Some adjectives are positive (like big, beautiful, or happy), and some are negative (like ugly, boring, or stupid). You can use adjectives to describe people in a variety of ways. For example, you might describe someone as: athletic (tall and runs fast) happy (smiles a lot) nice (friendly) polite (says please and thank you) shy (doesn't talk much) ugly (doesn't look nice) You can also describe someone as being the opposite of something. For example, you might describe someone as: annoying (makes you feel bad) boring (doesn't do anything interesting) clumsy (can't do things well) dirty (has dirt on them) ugly (doesn't look nice) You can also describe someone as being a combination of two or more adjectives. For example, you might describe someone as: annoying and shy (doesn't talk much but makes you feel bad) boring and ugly (doesn't look nice and doesn't do anything interesting) clumsy and dirty (can't do things well and has dirt on them) dirty and ugly (has dirt on them and doesn't look nice) You can use adjectives to describe people in a variety of ways.
