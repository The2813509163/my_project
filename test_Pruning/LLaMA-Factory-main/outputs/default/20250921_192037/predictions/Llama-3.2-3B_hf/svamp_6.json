If 3 people are sitting in the room, then the remaining 2 people are sitting on the floor. If 2 people are sitting in the room, then the remaining 3 people are sitting on the floor. If 4 people are sitting in the room, then the remaining 1 person is sitting on the floor. If 1 person is sitting in the room, then the remaining 4 people are sitting on the floor. If 0 people are sitting in the room, then the remaining 5 people are sitting on the floor. How many people are sitting in the room?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the number of people sitting in the room, we can use the given information to set up an equation. Let's say the number of people sitting in the room is x. Then, the number of people sitting on the floor is 5 - x. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:\n\nx + (5 - x) = 3 (when 3 people are sitting in the room)\nx + (5 - x) = 2 (when 2 people are sitting in the room)\nx + (5 - x) = 4 (when 4 people are sitting in the room)\nx + (5 - x) = 1 (when 1 person is sitting in the room)\nx + (5 - x) = 0 (when 0 people are sitting in the room)\n\nSimplifying each equation, we get:\n\n2x = 3\n2x = 2\n2x = 4\n2x = 1\n2x = 0\n\nDividing each equation by 2, we get:\n\nx = 1.5\nx = 1\nx = 2\nx = 0.5\nx = 0\n\nHowever, the number of people cannot be a fraction. Therefore, we need to re-examine the problem. Let's try to find a different approach.\n\nWe can start by noticing that the number of people sitting in the room must be a whole number. Therefore, we can try to find a whole number solution that satisfies the given",
