        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of apps Dave deleted as x.\nThen the number of files Dave deleted is 11 - x.\nThe number of files Dave has left is 3 + (11 - x) = 14 - x.\nThe number of apps Dave has left is 2 + x.\nThe difference between the number of files and apps is (14 - x) - (2 + x) = 12 - 2x.\nWe are given that Dave has 24 files and 2 apps left.\nSo 14 - x = 24 and 2 + x = 2.\nFrom the first equation, we get x = 10.\nFrom the second equation, we get x = 0.\nHowever, x cannot be both 10 and 0.\nLet's re-evaluate the problem.\nWe are given that Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone.\nAfter deleting some apps and files he had 24 files and 2 apps left.\nThis means that Dave deleted 8 files and 9 apps.\nSo the number of files Dave has left is 3 + 8 = 11.\nAnd the number of apps Dave has left is 2 + 9 = 11.\nThe difference between the number of files and apps is 11 - 11 = 0.\nThus, Dave has \\boxed{0} more files than apps left on the phone.
