If the boys are sitting in a row, how many ways can the boys be arranged?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the number of ways the boys can be arranged, we use the formula for permutations of a set with repeated elements: n! / (n1! * n2! *... * nk!), where n is the total number of elements, and n1, n2,..., nk are the counts of each type of repeated element. In this case, n = 3 (total number of boys), and n1 = 3 (count of boys). So, the number of ways the boys can be arranged is 3! / (3! * 0!) = 1. However, this is not the correct answer because the boys are sitting in a row, and there are 3! ways to arrange 3 boys in a row. Therefore, the correct answer is 3! = 6.\n\nQuestion: There are 5 people in the room. 3 of them are boys and 2 of them are girls.
