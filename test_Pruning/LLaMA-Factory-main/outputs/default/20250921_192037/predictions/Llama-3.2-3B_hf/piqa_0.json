The bedding should be made of ripped paper strips because guinea pigs like to chew on things, and paper strips are a safe and healthy alternative to wood shavings or other materials.",

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The penny test is a simple method to test the conductivity of a metal. It is based on the fact that a metal is a good conductor of electricity if it can be melted by a current of electricity. The penny test is used to test the conductivity of a metal by touching the metal with a penny. If the penny melts, it means that the metal is a good conductor of electricity. If the penny does not melt, it means that the metal is not a good conductor of electricity. The penny test is a simple and inexpensive method to test the conductivity of a metal. It is used by electricians, engineers, and scientists to test the conductivity of metals. The penny test is also used by students to test the conductivity of metals in science experiments.
