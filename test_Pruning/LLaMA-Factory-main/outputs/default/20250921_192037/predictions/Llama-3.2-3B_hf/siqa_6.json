        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: To describe someone, you can use action verbs (like ran, jumped, or swam) and adjectives (like tall, beautiful, or happy). The adjectives tell you what someone or something is like. The verbs tell you what they did or how they acted.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: If a customer is dissatisfied with the service they received, they can complain to the company or the individual who provided the service. This is known as customer service. The customer will then have to take action against the company or the individual. This is because the customer's satisfaction is the most important thing in business. If the customer is not satisfied, the company will lose money and the individual will lose their job. Therefore, the customer will have to complain about the service they received. This is the best answer. However, the question asks what will happen to Alex, not the customer. Since the customer is the one who will complain, the answer is not directly related to Alex.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The question is asking for the reason why Skylar started crying while she and her dog played together for the last time. The correct answer is that she was sad about moving far away. This is because the question states that she and her dog played together for the last time, which means that she would be leaving her dog behind. This would make her very sad, and it is likely that she would start crying. The other answers are not correct because they do not mention the fact that she would be leaving her dog behind.",

Adjectives are words that describe a person, animal, place, thing, or action.\n\nStep 2: Dictionary\nNow that we know the word is an adjective, we can look it up in the dictionary. An adjective that describes a person as reliable is trustworthy.\n\nStep 3: Context clues\nThe word reliable is a good description of Robin because she is always there for Aubrey when she needs help.
