        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: Eggs are a common food that can be stored for a long time. However, the expiration date on the eggs is not a guarantee that the eggs are bad. Instead, the expiration date is a guideline for how long the eggs can be stored before they start to lose quality. Eggs can be stored for a long time, but they will eventually start to lose quality. The best way to store eggs is to keep them in the refrigerator, where they will stay fresh for a long time. If the eggs are almost expired, you can still use them, but you should make sure to use them within the next few days. One way to do this is to crack the eggs and freeze them in plastic bags. This will help to preserve the eggs and keep them fresh for a long time. Another way to store the eggs is to bake them whole in their shells for six hours, and then freeze them. This will also help to preserve the eggs and keep them fresh for a long time. However, this method is not recommended, as it can be difficult to bake eggs whole in their shells for six hours. Therefore, the best way to store eggs that are almost expired is to crack them and freeze them in plastic bags. This will help to preserve the eggs and keep them fresh for a long time.",

        "origin_prompt": "How can I soak up spills on concrete?\nA. Use gravel kitty litter on spills.\nB. Use dry cat food on spills.\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A\nExplanation:  To soak up a spill on concrete, you can use gravel kitty litter.  Gravel kitty litter is made of small pieces of gravel that are coated with a substance that attracts moisture.  When you sprinkle gravel kitty litter on a spill, the moisture in the spill is attracted to the gravel and is absorbed into the kitty litter.  This helps to soak up the spill and prevent it from spreading.  Gravel kitty litter is also a good choice because it is easy to find and is relatively inexpensive.  You can also use other absorbent materials, such as dry cat food, to soak up spills on concrete.  Dry cat food is made of small pieces of food that are coated with a substance that attracts moisture.  When you sprinkle dry cat food on a spill, the moisture in the spill is attracted to the dry cat food and is absorbed into the food.  This helps to soak up the spill and prevent it from spreading.  Dry cat food is also a good choice because it is easy to find and is relatively inexpensive.  However, it is important to note that dry cat food is not as effective as gravel kitty litter at soaking up spills on concrete.  Therefore, if you have a large spill, you may want to consider using gravel kitty litter instead.  In addition to gravel kitty litter and dry cat food, you can also use other absorbent materials, such as paper towels, to soak up spills on concrete.  Paper towels are made of absorbent material that can soak up moisture and prevent it from spreading.  When you use paper towels to soak up a spill, you can simply place the paper towels on the spill and allow them to absorb the moisture.  This is a good option if you do not have gravel kitty litter or dry cat food available.  However, it is important to note that paper towels are not as effective as gravel kitty litter or dry cat food at soaking up spills on concrete.  Therefore, if you have a large spill, you may want to consider using gravel kitty litter or dry cat food instead.  In conclusion, there are many different ways to soak up spills on concrete, including using gravel kitty litter, dry cat food, and paper towels.  However, it is important to note that gravel kitty litter and dry cat food are the most effective options for soaking up spills on concrete.  If you have a large spill, you may want to consider using gravel kitty litter or dry cat food to soak up the spill and prevent it from spreading.  If",
