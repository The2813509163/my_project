        "prediction": "To find the number of apples Bob has, we first need to find the total number of apples Adam and Jackie have together. Let's call the number of apples Jackie has 'x'. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, they have x + (x + 4) = 14 apples. \n\nCombine like terms: 2x + 4 = 14\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides: 2x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 5\n\nSo Jackie has 5 apples. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.\n\nNow, let's find the total number of apples Adam and Jackie have together: 9 (Adam's apples) + 5 (Jackie's apples) = 14 apples.\n\nSince Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples.\n\nThe answer is 20.",

Since we know that the total number of emails is 10, we can set up the equation: 10 = 4 - x. To solve for x, we add x to both sides: 10 + x = 4. Then, we subtract 10 from both sides: x = -6. However, the number of emails cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-examine the problem. Let's try again. We know that Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. To find the number of emails he received in the evening, we subtract the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the day (10): 10 - 6 - 3 = 1.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation: A + (A + 8) = 12. This simplifies to 2A + 8 = 12. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2A = 4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 2. Since A = J + 8, we can substitute A = 2 into this equation to get 2 = J + 8. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives J = -6. However, the number of apples cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. We need to re-examine the equations. Let's try again. We know that A + J = 12 and A = J + 8. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation: A + (J + 8) = 12. This simplifies to A + J + 8 = 12. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives A + J = 4. Since A = J + 8, we can substitute A = J + 8 into this equation to get J + 8 + J = 4. This simplifies to 2J + 8 = 4. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2J = -4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives J = -2. However, the number of apples cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid. We need to re-examine the equations again. Let's try again.

Since we cannot have a negative number of oranges, we need to re-examine the problem.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem: \"They harvest 76 sacks per day and discard 64 sacks per day.\" This means that 76 - 64 = 12 sacks are actually harvested per day.
