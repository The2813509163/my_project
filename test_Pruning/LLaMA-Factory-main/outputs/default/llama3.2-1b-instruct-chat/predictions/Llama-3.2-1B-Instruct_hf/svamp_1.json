Now Ed lost some of his marbles, so he has (x + 19) - y marbles, where y is the number of marbles Ed lost. We are also told that Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. So we can set up the equation: (x + 19) - y = x + 8. To solve for y, we can first add y to both sides of the equation: (x + 19) = x + 8 + y. Then we can subtract x from both sides: 19 = 8 + y.

Since you can't play tag with a negative number of kids, we need to recheck the problem. Let's recheck the problem. Julia played tag with 15 kids on Monday, 18 kids on Tuesday and 97 kids on Wednesday. The total number of kids she played with is 15 + 18 + 97 = 130. Since Julia played with 15 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday, the number of kids she played with on Wednesday is 130 - 15 - 18 = 97.
