We also know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Let's denote the number of apples Jackie has as x. Then Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, they have x + (x + 4) = 14 apples. Solving for x, we get 2x + 4 = 14, which implies 2x = 10, and x = 5. So Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 9 apples. Together, they have 14 apples. Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together do. So Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. The answer is 20.",

They sold 186 t-shirts for $78 each, so they made 186 x 78 = 14658 dollars. Then, we subtract the amount they made from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas game (172 x 78 = 13284 dollars) from the total amount they made (14658 dollars): 14658 - 13284 = 672 dollars.
