However, I can try to provide a solution to the problem as stated in the prompt.\n\n## Step 1:  Determine the volume of the mixture to be frozen.\nThe mixture consists of 4 cups of chilled whipping cream, 14 oz. of sweetened condensed milk, and 1 16 oz. of chocolate flavored syrup. To find the total volume of the mixture, we need to add these amounts together.\n\n## Step 2:  Calculate the total volume of the mixture.\nTotal volume = 4 cups (whipped cream) + 14 oz (condensed milk) + 1 16 oz (chocolate syrup) = 4 + 14 + 1 = 19 oz.\n\n## Step 3:  Convert the total volume to a more manageable unit.\nSince the baking pan is 8x8x2 inches, we can convert the total volume from ounces to cubic inches. There are 1728 cubic inches in 1 cubic foot, and 1 foot = 12 inches, so there are 1728 * 12 = 20736 cubic inches in 1 cubic foot. Therefore, the total volume in cubic inches is 19 oz * 20736 = 394,096 cubic inches.\n\n## Step 4:  Determine the time the mixture needs to be frozen.\nThe mixture needs to be frozen for 8 hours until it reaches a firm inside the oven.\n\n## Step 5:  Consider the effect of Macadamia nuts on the firminess of the mixture.\nSince the problem doesn't specify how the Macadamia nuts affect the firminess of the mixture, we'll assume that they don't change the overall firminess of the mixture.\n\n## Step 6:  Provide the solution to the problem.\nThe solution to the problem is to freeze the mixture for 8 hours until it reaches a firm inside the oven.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
