Food moving through the intestines is a chemical change to food during digestion.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen food is digested, it moves through the intestines. This is a chemical change because the enzymes in the intestines break down the food into smaller pieces, and the resulting mixture is not the same as the original food.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Teeth chewing food is a physical change, not a chemical change.\n* Enzymes breaking down food is a chemical change, but it's not the only type of chemical change.\n* Food churning in the stomach is a physical change, not a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$",

It is a fundamental force in physics and is responsible for the ability of objects to move or change position. When two students stand ten feet apart, they can hear each other talk if the electric current is flowing through them, allowing them to hear the sound of each other's conversation.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. air vibrations: air vibrations are not a type of current, but rather a type of wave that flows through a medium, such as air or water. While air vibrations can be heard, they are not the same as electric current.\n\nC. solar radiation: solar radiation is a type of radiation that flows through a medium, such as the sun's atmosphere. While solar radiation can be heard, it is not the same as electric current.\n\nD. subatomic particles: subatomic particles are not a type of current, but rather a type of particle that flows through a medium.
