If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the number of crunches Zachary did, we add the number of push-ups he did (5) to the number of crunches he did (17). Therefore, Zachary did 5 + 17 = 22 crunches. To find the number of push-ups David did, we subtract the number of crunches Zachary did (22) from the number of push-ups David did (27). Therefore, David did 27 - 22 = 5 push-ups. To find the number of crunches David did, we subtract the number of push-ups David did (5) from the number of crunches Zachary did (17). Therefore, David did 17 - 5 = 12 crunches. To find the number of crunches Zachary did, we subtract the number of crunches David did (12) from the number of crunches Zachary did (17). Therefore, Zachary did 17 - 12 = 5 more crunches than push-ups. The answer is 5.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
