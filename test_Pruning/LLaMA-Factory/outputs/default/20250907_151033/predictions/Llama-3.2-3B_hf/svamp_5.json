How many apples does he have?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. We know that together they have 6 apples, so A + J = 6. We also know that Adam has 4 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do, so A = A + J + 4. We can simplify the second equation to A = J + 4. Now we can substitute A = J + 4 into the first equation: J + 4 + J = 6. Combining like terms, we get 2J + 4 = 6. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2J = 2. Dividing both sides by 2, we get J = 1. Now that we know J, we can find A: A = J + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Therefore, Adam has 5 apples.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.

Then, Jake has x peaches, and Steven has 4 + 11 = 15 peaches. Since Jake has x peaches, Steven has 15 - x peaches. Since Steven has 15 peaches, Jake has 15 - x peaches. Since Jake has 11 more peaches than Steven, Jake has 15 - x - 11 = 11. Therefore, Jake has 15 - x = 11, and x = 4. However, this is not possible since Jake has fewer peaches than Steven.

If Ed had 91 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the number of marbles Doug had, we subtract the number of marbles Ed had (91) from the number of marbles Ed had after losing some (which we don't know yet). Let's call the number of marbles Ed had after losing some \"x\". Then, we have 91 - x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 91 - 30 = 61. Therefore, Doug had 61 marbles. Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, we can find the number of marbles Ed had after losing some by adding 30 to the number of marbles Doug had: 61 + 30 = 91. Therefore, Ed had 91 marbles after losing some. Since Ed lost 21 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Ed had before losing some by subtracting 21 from 91: 91 - 21 = 70. Therefore, Ed had 70 marbles before losing some. Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, we can find the number of marbles Doug had before losing some by subtracting 30 from 70: 70 - 30 = 40. Therefore, Doug had 40 marbles before losing some. Since Doug had 61 marbles, we can find the number of marbles Ed had before losing some by adding 30 to the number of marbles Doug had before losing some: 40 + 30 = 70. Therefore, Ed had 70 marbles before losing some. Since Ed had 91 marbles after losing some, we can find the number of marbles Ed had before losing some by subtracting 21 from 91: 91 - 21 = 70.

Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 87 is not exactly divisible by 93, so we can't find a whole number of oranges in each group. But we can see that 87 is very close to 93, so we can assume that the number of oranges in each group is very close to 0.9339339339339339.

Let's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the number of oranges in each group, we divide the total number of oranges (87) by the number of groups (93): 87 / 93 = 0.9339339339339339 Therefore, each group of oranges contains 0.9339339339339339 oranges. Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 87 is not exactly divisible by 93, so we can't find a whole number of oranges in each group. But we can see that 87 is very close to 93, so we can assume that the number of oranges in each group is very close to 0.9339339339339339. The answer is 0.933",
