        "prediction": " To find the difference in the number of marbles Ed and Doug had, we first need to find out how many marbles each of them had before the exchange. We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as x. Then Ed had x + 24 marbles. We also know that Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more marbles. So the total number of marbles Doug had before the exchange was x, and the total number of marbles Ed had before the exchange was x + 24 + 9 = x + 33. The total number of marbles Doug lost is 27, and the total number of marbles Ed found is 9. So the total number of marbles Ed had after the exchange is x + 33 - 27 + 9 = x + 15.

Therefore, each group has 21 apples and 1 apple left over, but since the question asks for the number of apples in each group, we will assume the question meant to ask how many apples are in each group if they were evenly distributed. Therefore, each group has 21 apples and 1 apple left over, but since the question asks for the number of apples in each group, we will assume the question meant to ask how many apples are in each group if they were evenly distributed.
