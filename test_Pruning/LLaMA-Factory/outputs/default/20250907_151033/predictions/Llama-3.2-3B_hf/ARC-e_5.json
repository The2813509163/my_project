When light rays are refracted through a lens, they are bent back and forth until they hit the other side of the lens. This is why the cardboard box is a good answer. The cardboard box is a good material for making a lens, so it can refract light rays. The wooden door and the aluminum can are not good materials for making a lens, so they cannot refract light rays. The glass window is a good material for making a lens, but it is not a good answer because it is not a material that can be used to make a lens.
