        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A, the number of apples Jackie has as J, and the number of apples they have together as T. We know that T = A + J. We also know that A = J + 8 and T = A + 9. We can substitute A = J + 8 into T = A + 9 to get T = J + 8 + 9 = J + 17. We can also substitute T = A + J into T = A + 9 to get J + 9 = A + J + 9. We can simplify this equation to get 9 = 9, which is true for any value of J. However, we know that T = A + J = 12. We can substitute A = J + 8 into this equation to get J + 8 + J = 12, which simplifies to 2J + 8 = 12. We can subtract 8 from both sides of this equation to get 2J = 4. We can divide both sides of this equation by 2 to get J = 2. We can substitute J = 2 into A = J + 8 to get A = 2 + 8 = 10. Therefore, Adam has 10 apples and Jackie has 2 apples.
