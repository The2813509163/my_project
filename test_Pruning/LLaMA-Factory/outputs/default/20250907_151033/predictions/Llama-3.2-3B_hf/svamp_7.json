If 60 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the number of bird families that flew away for winter, we subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind (89 - x) from the total number of bird families (89). Since we don't know the exact number of bird families that stayed behind, we can't find the exact number of bird families that flew away for winter. However, we can find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and the number of bird families that stayed behind. The difference is 89 - x. Since we don't know the value of x, we can't find the exact answer. However, we can express the answer as 89 - x.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of bird families that flew away for winter, not the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and the number of bird families that stayed behind. Therefore, the answer is not a numerical value, but rather an expression.\n\nHowever, I will provide a numerical answer as the question requires it.\nThe answer is \\boxed{89 - x}.
