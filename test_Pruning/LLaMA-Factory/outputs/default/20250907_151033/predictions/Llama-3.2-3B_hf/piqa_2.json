        "prediction": " B\nExplanation:\nWhen you cook a mixture of apples, you can cook it in a pot on the stove. If you put it on high heat, it will boil and you will have a lot of bubbles. If you put it on medium-low heat, it will boil and you will have a lot of bubbles, but the mixture will not be as large as when you put it on high heat. If you put it on the stove and keep it there, bubbling, without stirring at all until there is less volume, it will take longer to cook than if you put it on high heat or medium-low heat.
