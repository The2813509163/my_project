If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages did she have to complete in all?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of pages Rachel had to complete in reading homework as x. Since she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, the number of pages she had to complete in math homework is x + 3. The total number of pages she had to complete is the sum of the pages she had to complete in math homework and reading homework, which is x + (x + 3). We know that the total number of pages she had to complete is 8 + 3 = 11. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + (x + 3) = 11. Solving for x, we get 2x + 3 = 11, which implies 2x = 8, and x = 4. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 4 pages of reading homework and 7 pages of math homework. The total number of pages she had to complete is 4 + 7 = 11. The answer is 11.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
