Food moving through the intestines is a chemical change to food during digestion.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen food is digested, it moves through the intestines. This is a chemical change because the enzymes in the intestines break down the food into smaller pieces, and the resulting mixture is not the same as the original food.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* Teeth chewing food is a physical change, not a chemical change.\n* Enzymes breaking down food is a chemical change, but it's not the only type of chemical change.\n* Food churning in the stomach is a physical change, not a chemical change.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{C}$",
