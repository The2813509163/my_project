To answer this, we need to understand the process of cutting and rooting plants and how it relates to genetic information.\n\nCutting and rooting plants involves taking a cutting of a plant and then growing it into a new plant. This process is similar to genetic engineering, where scientists manipulate genetic material to produce desired traits. However, the question is asking for a technology that uses genetic information in a similar way as cutting and rooting plants.\n\nOption A, genetic engineering, involves manipulating genetic material to produce desired traits. This is a direct application of genetic information to plants.\n\nOption B, DNA fingerprinting, is a method for identifying genetic variants in a sample of DNA. While it involves genetic information, it's more about identifying specific genetic traits rather than using genetic information to create new plants.\n\nOption C, cloning of organisms, involves creating a new organism from an existing one. This is a different type of process, as it doesn't directly use genetic information to create new plants.\n\nOption D, antibody therapy, is a treatment involving the use of an antibody to stimulate the immune system. While it involves a form of genetic information, it's more about the immune system's response to the antibody rather than using genetic information to create new plants.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate answer is genetic engineering, as it directly uses genetic information to manipulate the plant's genetic material.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]",
