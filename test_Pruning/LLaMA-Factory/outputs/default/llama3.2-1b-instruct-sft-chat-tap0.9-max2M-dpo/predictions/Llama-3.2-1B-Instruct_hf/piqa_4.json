This process involves sanding the wood veneer until it is smooth, and then applying the lacquer in three coats.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Sand the wood veneer until it is smooth. This involves sanding the wood veneer with a sanding brush to remove any rough or uneven surfaces.\n2. Apply three total coats of a clear gloss lacquer. This involves applying a thin layer of lacquer to the sanded wood veneer, and then repeating this process three times to cover the entire surface.\n3. To do this, apply a thin layer of lacquer with a paint brush. This involves applying the lacquer in a way that allows it to dry evenly.\n4.
