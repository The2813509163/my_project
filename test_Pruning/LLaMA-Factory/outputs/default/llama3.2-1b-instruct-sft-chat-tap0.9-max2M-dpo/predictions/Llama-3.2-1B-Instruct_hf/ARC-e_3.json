There are other appliances that can also convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, such as the heating of the air, the heating of the water, or the heating of the gas.\n\nBut, if we consider the heating of the air, the heating of the air can be converted into electrical energy, and then into mechanical energy.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]",
