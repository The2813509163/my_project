This is because the friction force is the force of attraction between the orange and the tray, and it is the only force that can cause the orange to roll off the tray.\n\nInertia of the orange is not relevant to the problem, as the orange is not moving.\n\nCentripetal force of the orange is also not relevant, as the centripetal force is the force of rotation around a central point, and it is not the force that causes the orange to roll off the tray.\n\nBalanced forces acting on the orange is also not relevant, as the forces acting on the orange are not balanced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]",

A topographic map: This would be the best option for reporting the strengths of these earthquakes over time. A topographic map is a three-dimensional representation of the Earth's surface, showing the shape of the Earth as a surface. By plotting the strength of the earthquakes on this map, we can visualize the trend of the earthquakes over time.\n\nB. A line graph: This would not be the best option for reporting the strengths of these earthquakes over time. A line graph is a two-dimensional representation of the Earth's surface, showing the relationship between the Earth's surface and the strength of the earthquakes. It would not provide a visual representation of the trend of the earthquakes over time.\n\nC.
