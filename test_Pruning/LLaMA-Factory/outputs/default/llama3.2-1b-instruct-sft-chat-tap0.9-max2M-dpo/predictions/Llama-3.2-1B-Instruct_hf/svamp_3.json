Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that 0.857 is closer to 1 than to 0, so we can round up to 1 and then check if 1 pack is enough. 1 pack costs 107 dollars, which is more than 93 dollars. Therefore, you can't buy 1 pack of dvds with 93 dollars. However, you can buy 0.857 of a pack, which is less than 1 pack. But since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, you can buy 0 packs and have 93 - 107 = -14 dollars left. This is not possible, so you can't buy 0 packs of dvds with 93 dollars. Therefore, the answer is that you can't buy any packs of dvds with 93 dollars. However, the question asks how many packs you can buy, and the answer is that you can't buy any packs.
