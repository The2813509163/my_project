Let's assume that Paul bought x books. Then, the number of books he had left is x - x = 0, which doesn't make sense. However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the number of books he had left after buying some, then the correct answer is x - x = 0, but this doesn't make sense.

Solving for x, we get x = 50 - 151 = -101. However, this is still not correct. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.
