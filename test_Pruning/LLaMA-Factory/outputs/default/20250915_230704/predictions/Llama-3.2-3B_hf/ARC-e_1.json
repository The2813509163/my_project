The best label for the x-axis is time, in\nA. seconds.\nB. minutes.\nC. hours.\nD. days.\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A. seconds.\nExplanation: The width of the river bank is the distance from the point where the river is at its widest to the point where it is at its narrowest. This distance is determined by the rate of erosion, which is the rate at which the river is moving. Since the river is moving at a constant rate, the width of the river bank is directly proportional to the time. Therefore, the best label for the x-axis is time, in seconds. The width of the river bank is the width of the river at any given time, which is determined by the rate of erosion.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The force of gravitational attraction between two objects depends on the distance between the objects and their masses. The force of gravity is a constant, so the distance between the objects and their masses do not affect the force of gravity. However, the force of gravity does affect the buoyancy of the objects. The buoyancy of an object is determined by its mass and the density of the fluid in which it is submerged. If an object is lighter than the fluid, it will be buoyed up. If an object is heavier than the fluid, it will be sunk. Therefore, the force of gravity does not affect the buoyancy of the objects, but it does affect the shape of the objects. The shape of the objects is determined by the force of gravity, which is a constant. The temperature of the objects does not affect the force of gravity, but it does affect the shape of the objects. The masses of the objects do not affect the force of gravity, but they do affect the shape of the objects. The shapes of the objects do not affect the force of gravity, but they do affect the buoyancy of the objects. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The force of gravitational attraction between two objects depends on the distance between the objects and their buoyancies. The buoyancies of the objects do not affect the force of gravity, but they do affect the shape of the objects. The shape of the objects is determined by the force of gravity, which is a constant. The temperature of the objects does not affect the force of gravity, but it does affect the shape of the objects. The masses of the objects do not affect the force of gravity, but they do affect the shape of the objects.

A drought can occur in a variety of ways, but one of the most common ways is when a large amount of water is stored in a lake or reservoir and then the water level drops. This can happen if the water level is too high and the water supply is not enough to cover the demand. In this case, the water supply is not enough to cover the demand, so the water level drops. This can cause problems for the farmers, as they need water to grow crops. The boating can be affected if the water level drops, but it is not the only activity that can be affected.

An oceanic trench is a line of trenches that is formed by a divergent plate boundary. A folded mountains is a line of folded mountains that is formed by a divergent plate boundary. The correct answer is a rift zone, which is a line of fractures that separates two plates and is likely to be formed by a divergent tectonic plate boundary.
