        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. We know that A + J = 6. We also know that A = J + 4. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get J + J + 4 = 6, which simplifies to 2J + 4 = 6. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 2J = 2. Dividing both sides by 2 gives J = 1. Now that we know J, we can find A: A = J + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Therefore, Adam has 5 apples.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.

If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of boys as x. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, the number of girls is x + 281. We know that the total number of pupils is the sum of the number of girls and boys, which is 868. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x + 281) = 868. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 281 = 868. Subtracting 281 from both sides, we get 2x = 587. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 293.5. Since the number of boys must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 293 boys and 281 girls. The total number of pupils is 293 + 281 = 574. The answer is 574.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
