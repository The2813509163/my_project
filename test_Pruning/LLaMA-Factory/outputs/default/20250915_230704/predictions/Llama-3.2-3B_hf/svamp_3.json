How many beads did each necklace need?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nTo find the number of beads needed for each necklace, we divide the total number of beads (2) by the number of necklaces (32): 2 / 32 = 0.0625. Therefore, each necklace needs 0.0625 beads. Since we can't have a fraction of a bead, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, the answer is not a whole number, so we can leave it as is. The answer is 0.0625.\n\nQuestion: The total number of students in the school is 100.

Together with game they earned 22 dollars. How much did ring toss game make per day?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nTo find the daily earnings of the ring toss game, we subtract the total amount earned from the total amount earned (excluding the ring toss game) from the total amount earned (including the ring toss game): 22 - 420 = -398. However, this is not possible since the ring toss game cannot earn a negative amount of money. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total amount earned from the ring toss game is 22 dollars. The total amount earned from the ring toss game and the game is 420 dollars. Therefore, the amount earned from the game is 420 - 22 = 398 dollars. Since the ring toss game makes the same amount of money each day, we divide the total amount earned from the ring toss game (22 dollars) by the number of days (30): 22 / 30 = 0.7333. Therefore, the ring toss game makes approximately 0.7333 dollars per day. However, since the problem states that the ring toss game makes the same amount of money each day, we can assume that the ring toss game makes a whole number of dollars per day. Therefore, the ring toss game makes 0 dollars per day.\n\nQuestion: The total number of students in the school is 30.
