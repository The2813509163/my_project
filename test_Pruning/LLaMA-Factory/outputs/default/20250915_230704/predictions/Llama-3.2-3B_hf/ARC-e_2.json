Lower mass creates higher gravitational pull.\nD. Higher mass creates higher gravitational pull.\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A.\nExplanation: The gravitational pull is the force of gravity acting on an object. The mass of an object is the amount of matter in it. The gravitational pull is directly proportional to the mass of the object. This means that if the gravitational pull is higher, the mass of the object will also be higher.

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The enzyme that acts first in response to the ingestion of a hamburger patty is the lipase in the small intestine. This enzyme breaks down the fat in the food, resulting in the production of the amino acids that are absorbed into the intestine. The amino acids are then absorbed into the intestine, where they are broken down into the amino acids that are absorbed into the bloodstream. The amino acids that are absorbed into the bloodstream are then broken down into the amino acids that are absorbed into the body.
