        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: When a predator feeding on certain prey is removed from the environment, the prey will most likely survive if the prey is not competing with other species. This is because the presence of other species can cause the prey to be eaten by the predator, thus reducing the chances of the prey surviving. Therefore, the variable that most likely determines whether or not the prey will survive is competition with other species. The answer is D.",

        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The student should use the same maze and reward each day to get the most accurate conclusion. This is because the maze is the same, so the mice will learn to navigate it in the same amount of time, regardless of the reward. The other options are not correct. Option A will make the maze bigger, but this will not affect the amount of time it takes for the mice to learn to navigate it. Option B will provide different food rewards, but this will not affect the amount of time it takes for the mice to learn to navigate the maze. Option C will use a reward other than food, but this will not affect the amount of time it takes for the mice to learn to navigate the maze. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
