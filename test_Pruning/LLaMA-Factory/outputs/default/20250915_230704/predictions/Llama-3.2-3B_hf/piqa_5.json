This way, you can see that the pencil is 1 unit long. Similarly, if you want to measure the length of a pencil, you can check its color by checking if it's black or white. For example, if you want to measure the length of a pencil, you can check its color by checking if it's black or white. If it's black, then it's 1 unit long. If it's white, then it's 1 unit long.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The vanilla bean is a seedless fruit that is used in the chocolate and vanilla flavors of ice cream. It is a seedless fruit because it has no seed, which means it is easy to slice. When slicing the vanilla bean, it is best to slice it in half across its full length using a paring knife. This will give you two equal halves of the vanilla bean. The paring knife is a small knife with a sharp edge that is designed to cut through the fruit. By slicing the vanilla bean in half, you can easily remove the inner part of the bean, which is the part that is used to make the ice cream. The butter knife is a large knife with a flat edge that is designed to cut through the fruit. By using the butter knife, you can easily remove the inner part of the vanilla bean, which is the part that is used to make the ice cream. However, the butter knife is not as sharp as the paring knife, so it will not cut through the vanilla bean as well. Therefore, the paring knife is the best tool to use to slice the vanilla bean.
