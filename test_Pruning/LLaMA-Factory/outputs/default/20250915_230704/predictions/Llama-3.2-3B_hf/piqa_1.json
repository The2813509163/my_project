After exercising or lifting weights extensively, apply a topical analgesic to the parts of the body you were training. Also apply an ice pack if needed to reduce swelling.\nB. When exercising or lifting weights, drink plenty of water. Being dehydrated increases the chances of pulling a muscle, or becoming sore after the exercise.\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The muscles of the body are made up of connective tissue, which is the same tissue that holds the bones of the body together. When the muscles of the body are pulled, they are essentially being pulled apart from their connective tissue. This connective tissue is also the same tissue that holds the bones of the body together. When the connective tissue is pulled, it can cause the muscles to become sore. When the muscles become sore, they can cause the connective tissue to become dehydrated, which can cause the connective tissue to become more rigid, and cause the muscles to become sore. When the connective tissue becomes dehydrated, it can cause the muscles to become sore. When the muscles become sore, they can cause the connective tissue to become more rigid, and cause the connective tissue to become more dehydrated, and cause the muscles to become sore.

By drilling a smaller hole first, you can ensure that the larger hole will be perfectly aligned and will not cause the wood to split.
