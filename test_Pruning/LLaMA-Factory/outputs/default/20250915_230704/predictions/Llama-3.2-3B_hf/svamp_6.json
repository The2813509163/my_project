Since the number of girls must be a whole number, we made a mistake. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that B = G + 510. We also know that B + G = 635. Substituting B in the second equation, we get (G + 510) + G = 635. This simplifies to 2G + 510 = 635. Subtracting 510 from both sides gives 2G = 125. Dividing both sides by 2 gives G = 62.5.
