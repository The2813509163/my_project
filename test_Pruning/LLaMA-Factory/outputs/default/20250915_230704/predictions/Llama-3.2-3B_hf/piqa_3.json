Simply roll up some paper towels as tight as possible without them breaking, dunk the ends in a glass of water, and lay the remaining across the soil so that each plant is at least a few inches away.\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because the plants will be at least a few yards away from each other. If you roll up the paper towels as tight as possible without them breaking, you will have a smaller bundle of paper towels. When you dunk the ends of the paper towels in a glass of water, the water will seep into the paper towels, making them more flexible. When you lay the remaining across the soil, the paper towels will be at least a few yards away from each other, which is the same as a few inches. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The window seal is made of silicone, which is a flexible material that can be stretched and molded. When the window is rolled up, the silicone sealant expands and contracts. The squeakiness of the window is caused by the sealant getting stuck in the track.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: When a pot of soup is cooked without a lid, the water evaporates, and the flavor of the soup is enhanced. This is because the water is heated, and the flavor compounds in the soup are dissolved in the water. When the water evaporates, the flavor compounds are released and the soup becomes more flavorful. This is why adding extra water to the pot at the end of cooking does not increase the flavor intensity of the soup.
