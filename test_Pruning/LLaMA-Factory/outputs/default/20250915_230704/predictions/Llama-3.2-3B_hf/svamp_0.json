If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially How many crackers did each person eat?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of crackers each person ate as x. \nSince Matthew had 32 crackers and 4 friends, the total number of crackers eaten is 4x. \nSimilarly, the total number of cakes eaten is 4y, where y is the number of cakes each person ate. \nSince Matthew had 98 cakes and 4 friends, the total number of cakes eaten is 4y. \nWe know that the total number of crackers eaten is equal to the total number of cakes eaten, so 4x = 4y. \nDividing both sides by 4, we get x = y. \nSince Matthew had 32 crackers and 4 friends, the total number of crackers eaten is 4x = 4 * 32 = 128. \nSince Matthew had 98 cakes and 4 friends, the total number of cakes eaten is 4y = 4 * 98 = 392. \nSince x = y, the total number of crackers eaten is equal to the total number of cakes eaten, so 128 = 392. \nThis is a contradiction, so the problem statement is incorrect. \nHowever, if we assume that the problem statement is correct, then the number of crackers each person ate is x = 32 / 4 = 8. \nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{8}.
