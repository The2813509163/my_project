The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped $57 - 5 = 52$ inches. The difference between the frog's jump and the mouse's jump is $57 - 52 = 5$ inches. The answer is \\boxed{5}. The answer is 5. Question: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse",

By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday, we subtract the number of crayons he lost or given away (551) from the total number of crayons he had (177): 177 - 551 = -374. Since we can't have a negative number of crayons, this means that Paul didn't get any crayons for his birthday. However, the question asks for the number of crayons he got, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's assume that Paul got 551 crayons and lost or given away 374 of them. In this case, the number of crayons he had left is 177. Since he got 551 crayons, the number of crayons he got for his birthday is 551 - 374 = 177. However, this is still not correct. Let's think about it again. If Paul got 551 crayons and lost or given away 374 of them, he would have 177 crayons left. But this is not possible since he got 551 crayons. Therefore, the correct answer is that Paul got 0 crayons for his birthday.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
