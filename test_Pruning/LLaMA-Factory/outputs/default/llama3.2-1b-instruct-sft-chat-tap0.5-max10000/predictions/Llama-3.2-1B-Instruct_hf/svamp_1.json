Since we are looking for the number of white t - items and we have a specific number of white t - items (which is 3 white t - items in the package), we can only determine that there will be one more of these items, which means that we will need one more of the white t - item in the package. However, the number of white t - items is not the number of the white t - item in the package, but rather that we have a specific number of white t - items that are in the package, which is 3 white t - items in the package. Therefore, the number of packages that will be needed is not yet determined, but we need to determine that we need to determine the number of other items that are in the package in order to determine the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number",
