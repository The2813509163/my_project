Thermometer and balance:\n- The thermometer can measure the height of the marble, but it's not accurate for comparing volumes.\n- The balance can measure the mass of the marble, but it's not accurate for comparing volumes.\n\nHowever, we can use the centimeter ruler and thermometer to compare the volumes of the marbles. The centimeter ruler can measure the height of the marble, and the thermometer can measure the height of the marble. Since the centimeter ruler and thermometer are both accurate for measuring the height of the marble, we can use them to compare the volumes of the marbles.\n\nBut we need to compare the volumes of the marbles, not the heights. To do this, we need to use the centimeter ruler and thermometer to measure the volume of the marble.
