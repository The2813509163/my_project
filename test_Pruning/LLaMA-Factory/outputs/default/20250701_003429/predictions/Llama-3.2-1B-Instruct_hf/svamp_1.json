The total number of peaches is the sum of the number of red peaches and the number of green peaches: x + (x + 10) = 10x + 10. We know that the total number of peaches is 594, so we can set up the equation: 10x + 10 = 594. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 10x = 584. Dividing both sides by 10 gives us x = 58.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a peach, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, there are 58 red peaches and 58 + 10 = 68 green peaches in the basket. The answer is 68.",

This means that Helen baked more raisin cakes than chocolate chip cookies. To find the correct answer, we need to subtract the number of raisin cakes from the number of chocolate chip cookies and then add the result to the number of raisin cakes: 231 - 237 = -6 and then 237 - 231 = 6. However, this is still not correct. The correct way to solve this problem is to realize that the question is asking for the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of raisin cakes. Since Helen baked more raisin cakes than chocolate chip cookies, the correct answer is the difference between the number of raisin cakes and the number of chocolate chip cookies, but in the opposite direction.
