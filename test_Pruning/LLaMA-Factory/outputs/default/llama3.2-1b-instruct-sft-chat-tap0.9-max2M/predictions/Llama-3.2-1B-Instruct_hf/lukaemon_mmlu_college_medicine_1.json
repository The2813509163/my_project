Therefore, the energy released by glucose is half the energy released by palmitic acid.\n\nThe energy released by leucine is 1/4 of the energy released by palmitic acid, since leucine is 1/4 of leucine. Therefore, the energy released by leucine is one-fourth the energy released by palmitic acid.\n\nThe energy released by alcohol is 1/8 of the energy released by palmitic acid, since alcohol is 1/8 of alcohol. Therefore, the energy released by alcohol is one-eighth the energy released by palmitic acid.\n\nSince the energy released by glucose is half the energy released by palmitic acid, and the energy released by palmitic acid is one-eighth the energy released by palmitic acid, the energy released by glucose is one-fourth the energy released by palmitic acid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A}} \\]",
