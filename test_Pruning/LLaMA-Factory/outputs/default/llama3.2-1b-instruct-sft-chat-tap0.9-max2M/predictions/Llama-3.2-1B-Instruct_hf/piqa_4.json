If the weight on the one side of the seesaw is equal to the plank itself, then one can conclude that the seesaw is balanced.\n2. If the weight on the either side of the seesaw is equal, then one can conclude that the seesaw is balanced.\n\nHowever, the seesaw is a balance device, and it can only be balanced if the weight on both sides is equal. If the weight on one side is equal to the plank, then the seesaw is not balanced. Therefore, we need to consider the case where the weight on either side is equal.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n* If the weight on the one side of the seesaw is equal to the plank itself, then the seesaw is balanced.\n* If the weight on the either side of the seesaw is equal, then the seesaw is balanced.\n\nSince the seesaw is a balance device, it can only be balanced if the weight on both sides is equal.

Therefore, we need to find the condition under which the weight on either side is equal.\n\nThe condition for the seesaw to be balanced is that the weight on either side is equal.
