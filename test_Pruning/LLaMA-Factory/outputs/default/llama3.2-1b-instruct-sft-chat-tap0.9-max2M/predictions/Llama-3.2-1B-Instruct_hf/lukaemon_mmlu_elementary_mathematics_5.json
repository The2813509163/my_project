Since Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, the number of seats to the right of Hector is x + 2 + 3 = x + 5. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, so the number of seats to the right of Tonya is x + 5 + 3 = x + 8. Since the total number of seats is 7, we can set up the equation x + (x + 8) = 7. Solving for x, we get 2x + 8 = 7, 2x = -1, x = -0.5. However, the number of seats cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. Since Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, the number of seats to the right of Hector is x + 2. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, so the number of seats to the right of Tonya is x + 2 + 3 = x + 5. Since the total number of seats is 7, we can set up the equation x + (x + 5) = 7. Solving for x, we get 2x + 5 = 7, 2x = 2, x = 1. This means that Kim sits 1 seat to the left of Tonya.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]",
