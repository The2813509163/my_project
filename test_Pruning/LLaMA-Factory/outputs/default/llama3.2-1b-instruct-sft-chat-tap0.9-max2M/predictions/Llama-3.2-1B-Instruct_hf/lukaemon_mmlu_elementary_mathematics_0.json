To find the time it takes for her heart rate to reach 120 beats per minute, we can set up the following equation:\n\n50 + 5x = 120\n\nwhere x is the number of minutes Trish exercises.\n\nSubtracting 50 from both sides gives:\n\n5x = 70\n\nDividing both sides by 5 gives:\n\nx = 14\n\nTherefore, it will take Trish 14 minutes to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nAnswer: B",
