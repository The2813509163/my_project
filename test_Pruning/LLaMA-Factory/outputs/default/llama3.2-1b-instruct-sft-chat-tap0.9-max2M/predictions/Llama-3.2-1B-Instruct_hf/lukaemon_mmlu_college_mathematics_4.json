In this case, the radius of the disk is the distance from the x-axis to the curve y = x/(1 + x^3).\n\nTo find this distance, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a curve. This is given by the formula:\n\nd = √((x - x1)^2 + (y - y1)^2)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point on the curve and (x, y) is the point on the disk.\n\nIn this case, the point on the curve is (0, 0), and the point on the disk is (x, x/(1 + x^3)). Therefore, the distance from the x-axis to the curve is:\n\nd = √((x - 0)^2 + (x/(1 + x^3) - 0)^2) = √(x^2 + x^2/(1 + x^3)^2)\n\nNow, we can integrate the area of the disk with respect to x to find the volume of the solid:\n\nV = ∫[0, 1] πd dx = π∫[0, 1] √(x^2 + x^2/(1 + x^3)^2) dx\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the substitution x = t^3, which gives dx = 3t^2 dt. This gives:\n\nV = π∫[0, 1] √(t^6 + t^6/(1 + t^6)^2) 3t^2 dt\n\nEvaluating this integral, we get:\n\nV = π∫[0, 1] √(t^6 + t^6/(1 + t^6)^2",

The area of the yard is $xy + yz + xz$. We can express $y + z$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ and $z$ using the perimeter equation. We can then express $xy + yz + xz$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ and $z$ using the expression for $y + z$.\n\nThe maximum possible area of the yard is obtained when $y = z$. In this case, the perimeter equation becomes $x + 2y + 2y = x + 4y$, so $y = z = x/4$. The area of the yard is then $xy + yz + xz = xy + y^2 + x^2/2$. This expression is maximized when $y = z = x/4$, so the maximum possible area of the yard is $x^2/16$.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{x^2}{16}} \\]",
