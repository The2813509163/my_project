It also has several movie theaters, an ice-skating rink, a small amusement park, and a branch of the local public library. The mall is advertised as \"a small town with a big-town feel.\" During shopping hours, a group of 10 protesters gathered in the pedestrian area near the entrance to a department store to denounce the sale of animal fur products in that store. The protesters were peaceful and did not interfere with traffic into or out of the store, but they carried signs and vocally communicated their message to people walking in the area. Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?\nA. No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.\nB. No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.\nC. Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\nD. Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.\nAnswer: \n"

Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. \nC.

The painter said that if the handyman would paint the house, the handyman could keep the $10,000 that the homeowner promised to pay. The handyman agreed. The next day, the handyman went to the homeowner's house to begin the painting job. The homeowner had already left for work, so the handyman began to paint the house.

The handyman told the homeowner of the arrangement he had with the painter.

The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers. Each deed contained the following provisions:\"It is an express covenant and condition that the property hereby conveyed shall not be used for other than single-family residences. \"\"The grantor hereby covenants for himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns to insert a similar restriction in all deeds to lots now owned by grantor in the 80- acre tract. \"In 1996, the county board of supervisors purchased from the attorney 30 lots within the 80-acre tract. The board, which had the power of eminent domain, planned to construct a new county pest-control office on the property. The deed of conveyance from the attorney to the county board of supervisors made no mention of the aforesaid restrictions contained in the deeds to other lot owners in the 80-acre tract. The attorney county deed, however, did contain a provision, which stated:\"The grantee hereby covenants for itself, its successors, and assigns that this conveyance is made in lieu of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. \"Thereafter, the county enacted a zoning ordinance whereby the 30 lots were rezoned to permit the construction of a pest-control office building. When the county started construction, all the other lot owners in the 80-acre tract brought suit to enjoin the building plan or, in the alternative, to recover damages.

Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road.

She never got around to reading the rest of the manual. Six months later, the graduate received a termination notice from the bar review course. The notice indicated that the graduate was being fired for insubordination because she had complained about the poor quality of the bar review course's materials and refused to work overtime grading papers. Following her dismissal, the graduate brought suit against the bar review course for breach of contract. Which of the following, if true and provable, would furnish the bar review course with its best defense?\nA. All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.\nB.

When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that\nA. the statute is void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nB. the statute is invalid because it violates the petitioner's freedom of speech under the First Amendment.\nC. the statute is an abridgment of freedom of speech under the First Amendment because less restrictive means are available for achieving the same purpose.\nD. the statute is overbroad and consequently invalid under the First and FourteenthAmendments.\nAnswer: \n"

The stockbroker decided to end his life by jumping off a bridge. He walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed over the railing, stood on the tiny ledge on the edge of the bridge, and prepared to jump. A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket. The taxi driver hung on tightly to the jacket and nearly was pulled over the side of the bridge, but he managed to hang on. Using every bit of strength he could muster, the taxi driver pulled the stockbroker back up and onto the bridge. The stockbroker was relieved to have been saved from falling. Unfortunately, the taxi driver suffered a severe injury to his back from the strain of hanging on to the stockbroker and pulling him back up onto the bridge. A statute in the jurisdiction makes attempted suicide a crime. If the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, will he prevail?\nA. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\nB. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction.\nC.

A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?\nA. Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\nB. No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.\nC. No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.\nD. Yes, because the victim in this case is called a \"predictably unpredictable plaintiff.\"\nAnswer: \n"

A police officer told the driver to turn it down, which he did. While explaining this, the officer spotted a handgun next to the driver on the seat. State law allowed the carrying of a concealed or unconcealed weapon. The officer ordered him out of the car for safety concerns. The officer drew her gun and pointed it at him as he got out, threatening to shoot him if he was not compliant. Other officers approached with weapons drawn. The driver was put on the ground and handcuffed. Drugs were found inside the car and he was charged with drug possession. He filed a motion to suppress, claiming a Fourth Amendment violation. What is the most likely decision of the court?\nA. The driver was acting erratically by blasting music in the middle of an auto accident investigation, and when a gun was spotted this justified a custodial interrogation and a search of the car.\nB. The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.\nC. The officer in effect overreacted to the initial purpose of the stop, and initiated an arrest procedure without probable cause to do so, and thus the drugs will be suppressed.\nD. The drugs will be suppressed because the officer had no right to order the driver out of the car simply because a legal weapon was observed on the seat.\nAnswer: \n"

The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee.

The written lease agreement specified that rent should be paid at a rate of $2,000 per month and provided that the tenants were required to pay two months rent initially, of which one half, or $2,000, should be held by the landlord as a security deposit. In addition, the lease contained the following provision:\"The duration of this lease shall be month-to-month and either party may have the right to terminate on thirty (30) days notice. \"The lease agreement did not specify whether notice of termination must be in writing, but it did provide that the deposit could be applied, at the landlord's option, to unpaid rent and to reimbursement for damage done by the tenant(s) to the apartment or the fixtures attached thereto. On January 1, the husband and wife paid the landlord $4,000 and moved in. The tenants then paid the $2,000 rent on the first of each of the months of February, March, and April, and all rents were duly accepted by the landlord. On February 1, the city enacted a housing code applicable to all multiple dwellings in the city. A provision of that code required that in \"any building having a main or central entrance that is open and accessible to the public directly from a public street, a doorkeeper shall be maintained on duty at all times. \" Although the landlord's building has such an entrance, the landlord failed to comply with the requirement. On March 15 and again on April 1, the husband and wife lodged complaints with the city's housing authority relating to the landlord's failure to hire a doorkeeper in violation of the code regulation. On April 5, the landlord orally gave notice to the tenants that he was terminating the lease and demanded that they vacate the premises by May 5. No damage was done to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures. There is no statute applicable to cover any landlord tenant dispute except those related to housing and building codes. In the landlord's action to evict, the husband and wife have contested the landlord's right to terminate on May 5. If the tenants prevail, it will probably be because\nA. there was no damage to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures.\nB. the statute of frauds requires that the notice of termination be in writing.\nC. the jurisdiction recognizes that retaliatory actions are a defense.\nD. the husband and wife have the option to apply their $2,000 deposit to cover May's rental.\nAnswer: \n"

The prosecution alleges that on December 17, the husband murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinyicholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. Further allegations claim that the husband's principal motive was to collect his wife's $500,000 life insurance policy under which he was the named beneficiary. The defense called the physician who signed the wife's death certificate as its first witness. The defendant's attorney asked her, \"Is it not true that the cause of death was a heart attack?\" The physician answered in the negative and stated that the cause of death was unknown. The husband's attorney then assailed her testimony as a recent fabrication and asked her if she had not stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack. The prosecution immediately objected to this question. The trial judge should rule that this question is\nA. objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.\nB. objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\nC. unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\nD. unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\nAnswer: \n"

Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\nA. grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. \nB. grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. \nC. deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. \nD. deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nAnswer: \n"

                "prompt": "A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\nA. The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. \nB. Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. \nC. The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. \nD. By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nAnswer: \n"

                "prompt": "A mechanic agreed in writing to make repairs to a landscaper's truck for $12,000. The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?\nA. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\nAnswer: \n"
