Writing the experiment in order is the most important part of making directions for an experiment.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* If you're making a series of experiments, you need to write the first experiment, then the second, and so on. This way, you'll have all the experiments listed out before you start writing them.\n* If you're making a single experiment, you don't need to write it at all.\n* If you're making multiple experiments, you need to write each one in order, so that you can list them all before writing the final one.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]",
