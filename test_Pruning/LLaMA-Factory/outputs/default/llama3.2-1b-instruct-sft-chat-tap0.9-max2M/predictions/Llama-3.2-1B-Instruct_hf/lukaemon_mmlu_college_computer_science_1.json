Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting will deal effectively with the problem of deadlock. This is because the process will always be able to deal with the problem of deadlock, and will not be able to deal with the problem of deadlock until all resources are available.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]",
