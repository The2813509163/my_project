The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\nA. 2\nB. 2 - e^-2\nC. 2 + e^-2\nD. 2 + e^-4\nAnswer: \n"
