To maximize her utility, Carmen should buy fewer units of X and more units of Y, or buy fewer units of Y and more units of X. However, the question asks for the number of goods, not the consumption level. Therefore, the answer is not the number of goods, but the number of goods that would maximize her utility. Since the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good X is 5, and the marginal utility of the last dollar she spent on good Y is 10, she should buy 2 units of good X and 1 unit of good Y.
