Scrub off the rest of the soil, using a brush, soap, and hot water.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n* Step 1: Empty the gas tank (or run the mower until the tank is empty). This means you need to start the mower and let it run for a while to get rid of any debris in the gas tank.\n* Step 2: Disconnect the spark plug wire. This is a bit more complicated, but it's necessary to prevent the mower from running for too long and to avoid burning the deck.\n* Step 3: Stand the mower up on its side. This is a good idea, as it will allow you to spray the deck with a garden hose and scrub off the rest of the soil.\n* Step 4: Take a garden hose and spray the deck at full blast.
