If he left home for more than five minutes, for how many minutes was he away?\nThe minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 6 degrees per minute. The hour hand moves 30 degrees in 60 minutes, so it moves 0.5 degrees per minute. The difference between the two hands is 110 degrees, so the minute hand is 110 degrees ahead of the hour hand. Since the minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute, it will take 110/6 = 18.33 minutes for the minute hand to be 110 degrees ahead of the hour hand. However, this is not the only time when the minute hand is 110 degrees ahead of the hour hand. The minute hand will be 110 degrees ahead of the hour hand for 18.33 minutes, but it will also be 110 degrees ahead of the hour hand for 18.33 + 18.33 = 36 minutes.
