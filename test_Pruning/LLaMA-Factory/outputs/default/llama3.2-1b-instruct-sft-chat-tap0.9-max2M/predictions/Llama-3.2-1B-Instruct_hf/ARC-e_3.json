The ice cube's melting point decreases, which is not a correct explanation for why ice cubes will melt in a glass of tea.\n\nThe correct answer is B. The ice cubes will melt in a glass of tea because the ice cubes are gaining energy from the tea, which is a mixture of water and tea. The ice cubes will melt the tea, causing the ice to melt and the liquid to become more fluid. This is the correct explanation for why ice cubes will melt in a glass of tea.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",
