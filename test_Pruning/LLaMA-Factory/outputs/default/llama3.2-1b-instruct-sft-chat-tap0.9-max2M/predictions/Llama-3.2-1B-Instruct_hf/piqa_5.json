Pour 1/4th of the soda into the bottle:\n   \\[ \\text{Soda} = 1/4 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} = 0.25 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} \\]\n   \\[ \\text{Soda} = 0.25 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} \\]\n\n2. Add a pinch of baking soda:\n   \\[ \\text{Baking Soda} = 1/4 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} \\]\n   \\[ \\text{Baking Soda} = 0.25 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} \\]\n\n3. Add a few drops of hydrogen peroxide:\n   \\[ \\text{Hydrogen Peroxide} = 0 \\text{ (since it's not mentioned to be added)} \\]\n\n4. Shake the mixture properly:\n   \\[ \\text{Shake} = 1/4 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the total amount of liquid in the bottle:\n\\[ \\text{Total Liquid} = \\text{Mountain Dew} + \\text{Baking Soda} + \\text{Hydrogen Peroxide} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Liquid} = \\text{Mountain Dew} + 0.25 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} + 0 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Liquid} = 1.25 \\times \\text{Mountain Dew} \\]\n\nSo, the total amount of liquid in the bottle is 1.25 times the amount of Mountain Dew.\n\nTherefore, to make glow water, you need to mix the Mountain Dew with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, and then shake the mixture properly.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.}} \\]",
