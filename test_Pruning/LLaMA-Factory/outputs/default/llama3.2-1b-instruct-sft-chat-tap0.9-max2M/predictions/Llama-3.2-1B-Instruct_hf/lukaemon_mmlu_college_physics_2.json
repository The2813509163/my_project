The disk's total kinetic energy is conserved, so the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is the same as the fraction of the disk's total potential energy that is converted into rotational kinetic energy.\n\nThe potential energy at the top of the disk is given by:\n\\[ U = mgh \\]\n\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the disk, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the disk.\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy at the bottom of the disk is given by:\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere $v$ is the angular velocity of the disk.\n\nSince the disk rolls down an inclined plane without slipping, the angular velocity of the disk is constant, and we can write:\n\\[ v = \\omega \\]\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the disk.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for rotational kinetic energy, we get:\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2h \\]\n\nComparing this with the equation for potential energy, we see that:\n\\[ U = mgh = \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2h \\]\n\nThis means that the fraction of the disk's total potential energy that is converted into rotational kinetic energy is the same as the fraction of the disk's total angular velocity squared.\n\nSince the angular velocity of the disk is constant, the fraction of the disk's total angular velocity squared is constant. Therefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is also constant.\n\nThe only answer choice that is constant is:\n\\[ \\boxed{1/4} \\]",
