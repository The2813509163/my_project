The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period.

This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\nAnswer: \n"

After the investor had made several payments on the loan, she defaulted on two payments. The lender notified the man and the investor of its intention to accelerate the loan pursuant to the terms of the note and mortgage unless the default was cured within 60 days. When neither the man nor the investor made the required payment, the lender accelerated the loan and initiated foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the investor as party defendants. The foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency. The lender has sought a deficiency judgment against only the man, because the investor has become insolvent in the meantime. Will the court likely find the man liable for the deficiency?\nA. No, because the investor's express assumption of the loan released the man from liability.\nB. No, because the lender must first seek to obtain a deficiency judgment against the investor.\nC. Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\nD.

The animals' excrement was deposited throughout the house, they were kept in tiny pens, and some of the animals were sick. The visitor called the SPCA, a private non-profit humane society. State law authorized humane societies to receive abused or neglected animals from animal control officers, to care for them and adopt them out. The SPCA took the animals designated by the officers. The officers then arrested the women for animal neglect. At a hearing, the prosecutor was unprepared, and the judge dismissed the charges. The women then sued the officers and the SPCA under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 for civil rights violations. The SPCA defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on the absence of the \"state action\" on their part. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\nA. Yes, because there was nothing that was done by the humane society that involved police action.\nB. Yes, because the SPCA personnel did not at any time act \"under color of law\" in their actions.\nC.

The gambler explained that he wanted to place a bet with a sports-betting agency that his beloved team would win the college football championship the next year. The gambler further explained that he had read that the odds of his team winning the football championship next year were listed as 100-1, and he wanted to place a $1,000 bet on his team. The gambler told his friend that he would pay him for his efforts. After further discussion, the gambler wrote up the following agreement:\"I hereby promise to pay my friend $100 if he will place a $1,000 bet for me that my favorite team will win the college football championship next year. The bet is to be placed at my lucky casino sports book. I further promise to pay my friend an additional $100 within 30 days after the bet is placed. \"Since the gambler knew his wife would be angry if she found out about the bet, the gambler included a clause that the friend promised not to tell anyone about the bet. After both the gambler and his friend signed the agreement, the gambler gave him $1,100, representing $1,000 to place the bet and $100 as the initial payment for the friend's efforts. The friend then went on vacation. Shortly after arrival, the friend attempted to place the bet for the gambler. However, the friend discovered that the gambler's lucky casino had recently closed its sports book. The friend then entered another casino next door and discovered that they had a sports book, also offering 100-1 odds on the gambler's favorite team winning the college football championship the next year. The friend placed the bet with the other casino's sports book. After returning from his vacation, the friend gave the betting slip to the gambler. Nothing more was said until 30 days later, when the friend asked the gambler when he was going to receive the final $100. The gambler then refused to pay anything more to the friend. In a breach of contract action by the friend to collect the $100, which of the following, if true, is the gambler's best defense?\nA. The contract was void ab initio, because the contract could not be performed in its entirety within the span of one year.\nB. The friend's placing the $1,000 bet at the other casino instead of at the gambler's lucky casino constituted a material breach of contract, thereby relieving the gambler of any further contractual obligations under the terms of their agreement.\nC. While on vacation, the friend told his girlfriend about the $1,000 that he bet on the gambler's behalf.\nD. Since the gambler's lucky casino no longer had a sports book at which to place the bet, all contractual obligations would be suspended under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\nAnswer: \n"

On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator. When the doors opened, several people were already inside the elevator, apparently having entered the elevator from the parking garage below the building. One of the people in the elevator was a man who acted shifty and nervous. By the 12th floor, only four persons were left, including the woman and the man. At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse. When the woman resisted, the man struck her, and she fell unconscious. When the woman recovered consciousness, she found herself in a hospital with a concussion and multiple contusions on her body. She later learned that the elevator had remained stalled for 50 minutes. Thereafter, it moved to the 20th floor, where she was found by her friend, who took her to the hospital. Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building. The elevator's stalling was caused by a defective cable that a routine inspection would have discovered. If the woman brings suit against the owner of the apartment building for negligence, she will most likely\nA. recover, because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\nB. recover, because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\nC. not recover, because the woman was negligent in failing to exit the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants exited the elevator.\nD. not recover, because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\nAnswer: \n"

The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30.

Two police officers arrived at the store. They gathered information from the store owner, who signed a criminal complaint against the woman. The officers then discussed the matter with the woman.

The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\nA. The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.\nB. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\nC. The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.\nD.

The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements.

In 1974, the landowner conveyed the tract to the town development association \"on condition that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon and the land be used solely for skiing purposes and, in the event that said property is not used as a ski resort, the property shall revert to myself, the grantor, my heirs or assigns. \" Subsequently, a ski lodge was built and the land was continuously used as a ski resort for more than 20 years. In 1979, a neighbor, owner of a farm abutting the northeast corner of the 10-acre tract, began to use a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm. He used this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The period of prescription in this particular jurisdiction was 20 years. In March 2000, the neighbor decided to sell the farm to a skier. Thereupon, the neighbor and the skier entered into a written real estate sales contract, with closing set for May 1, 2000. On April 1, 2000, the president of the town development association was approached by the skier with the request that a written easement be given over the used area and that an appropriate instrument be delivered to the skier concurrently with the skier's closing with the neighbor. Following the president's meeting with the skier, the town development association held a duly announced meeting and voted unanimously to authorize its trustees to grant such an easement. On April 15, 2000, the landowner died. The landowner's sole descendant and successor in interest was his wife. Upon her husband's death, the wife immediately notified the town development association that if it granted the easement to the skier, the 10-acre tract would revert to her. The skier then brought an appropriate action, joining the neighbor, the wife, and the town development association, seeking a declaratory judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract. In this action, judgment should be in favor of which of the following parties?\nA. The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\nB. The wife, because the easement would violate the negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose.\nC. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\nD. The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\nAnswer: \n"

His favorite team lost in extra innings. After the game, the boyfriend became despondent and told his girlfriend that he was so disgusted that he was going to kill himself. The boyfriend took one of the pistols from his gun collection and shot himself in the head. As the boyfriend fell to the floor, wounded, his girlfriend couldn't believe her eyes.

                "prompt": "An elderly married couple was shopping in a crowded retail store. The husband was several feet ahead of his wife when she saw him slip and lose his balance. He was able to prevent a fall by holding onto a counter. Wife saw something sticky on a wide part of the floor but became disoriented by seeing her husband slipping and gripping the counter. With other shoppers behind her, she stepped forward and fell on the wet floor, breaking her hip, and requiring extensive complicated surgeries. She sued the store for negligent maintenance. She proved through discovery that the retailer did not clean the mess soon enough and did not put up a warning sign. The store filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, alleging that the wife voluntarily assumed the risk as a matter of law. The trial court agreed, ruling there was no issue of material fact in dispute for the jury to decide. On appeal, is it likely that the appellate court will reverse and remand for a new trial?\nA. No, because wife proceeded to encounter a known danger voluntarily, thereby assuming the risk of injury as a matter of law and there were no material issues of fact for a jury to decide.\nB. No, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party under Rule 56, it is nonetheless clear that she knew there was a danger and she accepted the risk.\nC. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\nD. Yes, because the store was strictly liable to the wife, who was a customer invited on the premises to do business and the store had to protect her.\nAnswer: \n"

A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD.

In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?\nA. Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\nB.

No, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet.\nB.

There he noticed that the marquis in the parking lot was unlit and covered in a banner that read, \"Casino Temporarily Closed Due to Renovations. \" Unable to reach the businessman by telephone, the employee placed the bet at another gaming establishment located next door to the casino. The following morning, the employee flew back and gave the betting receipt to the businessman. When the businessman saw that the bet had been made at another gaming establishment, he angrily told the employee, \"I purposely directed you to wager that $10,000 at the casino. Since you failed to follow my instructions, the deal's off. \" As a result, the businessman refused to pay the employee the $500. If the employee initiates suit for breach of contract, the court will most likely determine that placing the $10,000 wager at the other gaming establishment, rather than at the casino, constituted a\nA. breach of contract.\nB. modification.\nC. constructive condition precedent that was substantially performed.\nD. discharge by impossibility.\nAnswer: \n"

The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, \"Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass. \" The farmer replied, \"Sorry, Pops, but I've acquired an easement over that roadway, and I'll continue to use it anytime I want. \"Then, the widower institutes an appropriate action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove.

The neighbors are requesting an injunction to stop these activities and for remedial measures. The club defends that it cannot control its customers after they leave the premises, and it reminds the court that it has zoning approval. Its approval, however, is based on a grandfather clause that allows it as a non-conforming use  otherwise, the area surrounding the club is strictly residential. Will the court likely issue an injunction to attempt to alleviate the neighbor's problems?\nA. No, the right of free speech granted to a strip club outweighs the minor and temporary inconvenience of the neighbors.\nB. Yes, the interference is substantial, unreasonable and continuous  an injunction will be fashioned to control the nuisance.\nC. No, because there is no remedy for interference with use and enjoyment of land other than a tort action for trespass or to abate an abnormally dangerous condition.\nD.

                "prompt": "On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely\nA. grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction. \nB. grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan. \nC. deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree. \nD. deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as \"a structure\" within the terms of the restriction. \nAnswer: \n"

                "prompt": "A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?\nA. The father's promise and the creditor's reliance thereon, if proved, gave rise to a valid claim by the creditor against the father based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. \nB. Because it was foreseeable that the father's promise would induce the creditor to forbear taking any action against the son, such forbearance was, as a matter of law, a bargained-for consideration for the father's promise. \nC. The father's five payments to the creditor totaling $2,500 manifested a serious intent on the father's part to be contractually bound, and such manifestation is generally recognized as an effective substitute for consideration. \nD. By assuming the antecedent debt obligation that the son owed to the creditor, the father became a surety whose promise to the creditor was enforceable, since it was in writing and supported by adequate consideration. \nAnswer: \n"

                "prompt": "A student was a junior criminology major at state university and a member of a fraternity. While new members were pledging the fraternity, the student had a reputation for initiating pranks and hazing the pledges. Late one night, after a fraternity party, the student decided to kidnap one of the pledges. Enlisting the help of his friend, they grabbed the pledge, tied him up, and locked him in the trunk of the student's car. They then drove into the downtown section of a city where they dropped the pledge at a street corner. While the pledge was wandering around and trying to find a telephone booth, a gang of youths saw his predicament and attacked him. The pledge, who was severely beaten, suffered a broken nose, multiple lacerations, and contusions. When the pledge finally returned to the school, he filed a criminal complaint against the student who was charged with violating a state law, which provides:\"Every person who hazes a student and thereby is responsible for causing bodily harm to said student is guilty of a felony punishable by three years in prison. \"At thai, the prosecuting attorney called the student's alleged accomplice as a witness. The friend refused to answer any questions and was cited for contempt. After the friend left the witness stand, the prosecutor offered into evidence a transcript of the friend's testimony given at the student's preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, the friend testified under oath that he and the student were responsible for hazing the pledge and driving the victim against his will to the city. During the preliminary hearing, the friend was also cross-examined by the student's defense counsel. Over defense objections, the trial court admitted the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing. Thereafter, the student was convicted of violating the aforementioned hazing statute. The student appeals the conviction and contends that the admission of the transcript of the friend's testimony at the preliminary hearing violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. As to this claim, the student's appeal will most likely be\nA. granted, because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the witness at trial.\nB. granted, because in order to admit prior testimony, the witness must be shown to be unavailable.\nC. denied, because the witness was unavailable, and there was adequate opportunity for crossexamination at the preliminary hearing.\nD. denied, because the testimony was a statement by a co-conspirator and, therefore, admissible as a recognized exception to the hearsay rule.\nAnswer: \n"
