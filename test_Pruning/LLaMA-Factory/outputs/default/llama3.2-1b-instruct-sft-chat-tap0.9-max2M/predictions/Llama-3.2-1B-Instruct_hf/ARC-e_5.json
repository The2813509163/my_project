        "prediction": "To determine which object refracts light rays, we need to consider the properties of refraction. A refraction occurs when a surface absorbs light, rather than reflecting it. This happens when the surface is not transparent or reflective.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Wooden door: A wooden door is a flat surface that is not transparent or reflective. When you cut a wooden door, it will absorb light rays, but it will not refract them. So, this option is not correct.\n\nB. Cardboard box: A cardboard box is a flat surface that is not transparent or reflective. When you cut a cardboard box, it will absorb light rays, but it will not refract them. So, this option is not correct.\n\nC. Aluminum can: An aluminum can is a flat surface that is not transparent or reflective. When you cut an aluminum can, it will absorb light rays, but it will not refract them. So, this option is not correct.\n\nD. Glass window: A glass window is a flat surface that is not transparent or reflective. When you cut a glass window, it will absorb light rays, but it will not refract them. So, this option is not correct.\n\nHowever, there is one more option that is not listed above: the glass window is not listed, but it is a flat surface that is not transparent or reflective. When you cut a glass window, it will absorb light rays, but it will not refract them. So, this option is not correct.\n\nWait, there is another option: the glass window is not listed, but it is a flat surface that is not transparent or reflective.
