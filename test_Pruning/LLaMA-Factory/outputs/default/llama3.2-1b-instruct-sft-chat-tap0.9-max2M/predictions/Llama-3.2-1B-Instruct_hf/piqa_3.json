This means that the number of plums is 4 times the number of dumplings, since each quartered plum is equivalent to 1/4 of the original plum.\n\nLet's denote the number of plums as $x$. Then, the number of dumplings is $4x$. Since the recipe makes at least 20 dumplings, we can set up the inequality:\n\\[ 4x \\geq 20 \\]\n\nTo find the minimum number of plums, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 4:\n\\[ x \\geq 5 \\]\n\nSo, the minimum number of plums needed is 5.\n\nOption 2: Halving\nIf we halve the plums, the recipe should make at least 20 dumplings. This means that the number of plums is 2 times the number of dumplings, since each halved plum is equivalent to 1/2 of the original plum.\n\nLet's denote the number of plums as $x$. Then, the number of dumplings is $2x$.
