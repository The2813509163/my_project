These indicate which way to insert the filter into the slot.\n\nExplanation:\nAir filters can be installed in any direction, but when you insert the filter into the slot, the arrow markers indicate the direction. This is because the arrow markers are pointing in the direction of the air flow, and installing the filter in the correct direction will ensure that it will not cause any air to enter the slot.\n\nFor example, if you have a filter with an arrow marker pointing to the right, you should insert it into the slot to the right of the arrow marker. If you have an arrow marker pointing to the left, you should insert it into the slot to the left of the arrow marker.\n\nThis is a fundamental concept in air conditioning, and it's essential to understand how air filters work and how to properly insert them into the slot.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",
