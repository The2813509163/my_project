An increase in undersea volcanic activity is a phenomenon that contributes to the increase in global temperatures.\n\nExplanation:\nThe increase in global temperatures over the past 100 years is due to the increase in undersea volcanic activity. This phenomenon is caused by the increase in the volume of volcanic activity, which is a result of the increase in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe other options do not contribute to the increase in global temperatures:\n\n* B. A decrease in the distance between Earth and the Sun would result in a decrease in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, not an increase.\n* C. An increase in certain gases released during the use of fossil fuels would also result in a decrease in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, not an increase.\n* D.
