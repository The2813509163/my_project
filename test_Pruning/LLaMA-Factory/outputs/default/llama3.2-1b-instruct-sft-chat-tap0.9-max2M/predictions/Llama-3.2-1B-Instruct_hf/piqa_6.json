Lay the tomato seeds closely together over used coffee filter paper.\n2. If the seeds are small enough, you can wrap them around the coffee filter paper to create a \"drying layer\" that will help them dry.\n3. If the seeds are larger, you can place them with space over fresh coffee filter paper, allowing for a \"drying layer\" that will help them dry.\n\nThis method works because the coffee filter paper will absorb moisture, and the seeds will dry as they dry.

Poke it with the knife every 2-3 minutes, until it stops bleeding:\nWhen you poke the steak, it will stop bleeding if the knife is at the right angle and the steak is not too thin. If the knife is too thin, the steak will continue to bleed.\n\nNote: This method is not foolproof and may not always result in a perfectly cooked steak.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A}} \\]",
