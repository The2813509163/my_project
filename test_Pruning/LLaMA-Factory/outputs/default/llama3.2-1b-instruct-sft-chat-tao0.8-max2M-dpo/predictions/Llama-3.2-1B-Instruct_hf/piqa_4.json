The poptart pie dough is cut into rectangles and triangles, both of which are 3 by 5 inches in size.\n\nCutting rectangles the size of a poptart, 3 by 5 inches, means that each side of the rectangle will be 3 inches long. Since the poptart dough is cut into rectangles, the total area of the dough will be the product of the number of rectangles and the area of each rectangle.\n\nCutting triangles the size of a poptart, 3 by 5 inches, means that each triangle will have a base of 3 inches and a height of 5 inches. The area of each triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (base × height) / 2\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nArea = (3 × 5) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5 square inches\n\nSince the poptart dough is cut into rectangles and triangles, the total area of the dough will be the sum of the areas of the rectangles and the triangles.\n\nLet's assume there are x rectangles and y triangles. Then, the total area of the dough will be:\n\nTotal Area = x × (3 × 5) + y × (3 × 5) = 15x + 15y\n\nSince the total area of the dough is equal to the area of the poptart pie dough, we can set up the equation:\n\n15x + 15y = Area of poptart pie dough\n\nHowever, the problem statement does not provide the area of the poptart pie dough.
