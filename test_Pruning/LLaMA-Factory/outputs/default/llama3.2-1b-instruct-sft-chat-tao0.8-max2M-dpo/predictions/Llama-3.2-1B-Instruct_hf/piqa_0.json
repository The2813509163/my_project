Since there are many pieces in an egg carton, you can cut it into 2 pieces and then cut each piece into 2 pieces, and so on. This will give you a total of 2^n pieces, where n is the number of pieces in the carton.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify the number of pieces in the carton. Let's assume the carton has 3 pieces (a carton typically has 3 pieces: a egg carton, a egg yolk, and a egg carton).\n\nCutting 3 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 3 x 2 = 6 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 6 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 6 x 2 = 12 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 12 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 12 x 2 = 24 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 24 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 24 x 2 = 48 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 48 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 48 x 2 = 96 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 96 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 96 x 2 = 192 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 192 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 192 x 2 = 384 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 384 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 384 x 2 = 768 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 768 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 768 x 2 = 1536 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 1536 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 1536 x 2 = 3072 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 3072 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 3072 x 2 = 6144 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 6144 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 6144 x 2 = 12288 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 12288 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 12288 x 2 = 24576 pieces.\n\nCutting each of these 24576 pieces into 2 pieces each will give you 24576 x 2 = 49152 pieces.\n\n",

Pour the shredded butter into a shallow bowl.\n3. Pour the remaining butter into a separate bowl.\n4. Use a cheese grater to shave some of the butter off.\n5. Pour the shredded butter like you would cheese into the bowl.\n\nThis way, you can spread butter evenly and use a cheese grater to make it easier to spread.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{B}$",
