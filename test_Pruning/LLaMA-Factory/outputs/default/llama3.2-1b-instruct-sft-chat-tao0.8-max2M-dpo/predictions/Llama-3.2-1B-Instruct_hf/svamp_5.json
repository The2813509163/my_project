Since we can't have a fraction of a pupil, we round down to the nearest whole number. So there are 293 boys and 293 + 281 = 574 girls. Therefore, there are 574 + 293 = 867 pupils in the school.

This means that Paul actually had more crayons than he lost. Let's rephrase the question: How many crayons did Paul get for his birthday? Since he had more crayons than he lost, he must have had 563 crayons and gave 563 - 558 = 5 crayons to his friends. However, this is still not correct.
