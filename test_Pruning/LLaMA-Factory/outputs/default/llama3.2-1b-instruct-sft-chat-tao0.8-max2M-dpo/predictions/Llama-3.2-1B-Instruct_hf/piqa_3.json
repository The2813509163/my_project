Since borax will kill odorous house ants and powdered milk will attract them, we need to mix borax with 3 parts powdered sugar.\n\n## Step 2:  Determine the number of tiny containers needed to hold the ant bait.\nSince we need to mix borax with 3 parts powdered sugar, we can fill tiny containers with this homemade ant bait. Let's assume we have x containers. We need to fill x tiny containers with borax and 3x tiny containers with powdered sugar.\n\n## Step 3:  Calculate the total amount of ant bait needed.\nThe total amount of ant bait needed is the sum of borax and powdered sugar. Since we have 3x tiny containers with borax and 3x tiny containers with powdered sugar, the total amount of ant bait needed is 3x + 3x = 6x.\n\n## Step 4:  Determine the number of tiny containers needed to hold the ant bait.\nSince we have 6x tiny containers needed to hold the ant bait, we can fill these containers with the homemade ant bait.\n\n## Step 5:  Calculate the final answer.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$",
