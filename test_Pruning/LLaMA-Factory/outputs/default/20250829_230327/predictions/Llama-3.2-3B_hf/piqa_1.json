This way, the fish will not break apart and will be perfectly tender and juicy. The second method is to use a spatula to lift the fish gently after 2 minutes, and then continue to cook, checking at 30-second intervals, until it releases. This method is also effective, but it requires more time and attention to the cooking process. Both methods are equally effective, but the second method is more time-consuming and requires more attention to the cooking process.
