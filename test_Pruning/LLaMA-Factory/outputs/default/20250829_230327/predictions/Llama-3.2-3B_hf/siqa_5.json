        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The answer is B because it describes the emotion of sentimentality, which is a feeling of deep sadness and longing. The phrase \"Quinn saw their dog get hit by a car\" implies that the dog was killed, and the dog's death would cause Quinn to feel a deep sense of loss and longing for the dog. This is the definition of sentimentality. The answer choices A, C, and D do not describe this emotion. The answer choice B is the correct one. The reason is that it is the only answer choice that describes the emotion of sentimentality. The other answer choices describe other emotions, such as anger, sadness, and vengefulness.
