If the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, what is the height of the 1-year-old boy?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the height of the 1-year-old boy, we first find the height of the 3-year-old boy, which is 3 times the height of the 1-year-old boy. Let's denote the height of the 1-year-old boy as x. Then the height of the 3-year-old boy is 3x. Since the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can set up the equation: 3x = 3x. However, this equation is not helpful. Instead, we can set up the equation based on the fact that the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother. Let's denote the height of the 5-year-old boy as y. Then the height of the 3-year-old boy is y/5. Since the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can set up the equation: y/5 = 3x. We also know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, so we can set up the equation: y = 5(y/5). Simplifying this equation, we get: y = 5y/5. This equation is still not helpful. Let's try a different approach. We know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother. Let's denote the height of the 3-year-old boy as x. Then the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5x. Since the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can set up the equation: 5x = 3x + x. Simplifying this equation, we get: 5x = 4x. This equation is",

If the boy's height is 36 inches, what is the boy's height in inches?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the boy's height, we can set up a proportion using the information that the boy's height is 5 times his brother's height. Let's call the boy's height \"x\" and the brother's height \"y\". We know that x = 5y. We also know that x = 36 inches. So, we can set up the equation: 5y = 36. To solve for y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5: y = 36 / 5 = 7.2. Now that we know the brother's height, we can find the boy's height by multiplying the brother's height by 5: x = 5y = 5(7.2) = 36. Therefore, the boy's height is 36 inches. The answer is 36.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother.

If the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, what is the height of the 1-year-old brother?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nLet's denote the height of the 1-year-old brother as x. Since the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, the height of the 3-year-old boy is 3x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5(3x) = 15x. We know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 years older than the 3-year-old boy, so the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5 times the height of the 3-year-old boy. Therefore, 15x = 5(3x) = 15x. This equation is true for any value of x, so we need to use the fact that the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother to find the value of x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5 times the height of the 3-year-old boy. Therefore, the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5 times the height of the 1-year-old brother. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 years older than the 3-year-old boy, the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5 times the height of the 1-year-old brother. Therefore, the height of the 1-year-old brother is 1/5 of the height of the 5-year-old boy. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5 times the height of the 3-year-old boy.

If the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, what is the height of the 1-year-old brother?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the height of the 1-year-old brother, we first find the height of the 3-year-old brother. Since the 3-year-old brother is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 1-year-old brother as x. Then, the height of the 3-year-old brother is 3x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 5-year-old boy as 5(3x). We know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 years older than the 3-year-old boy, so we can set up the equation: 5(3x) = 5(3x) + 5. However, this equation is not correct. Instead, we can set up the equation: 5(3x) = 3x + 5. Solving for x, we get: 15x = 3x + 5. Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get: 12x = 5. Dividing both sides by 12, we get: x = 5/12. Therefore, the height of the 1-year-old brother is 5/12. However, this is not the correct answer. Let's try again. Since the 3-year-old brother is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 1-year-old brother as x. Then, the height of the 3-year-old brother is 3x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 5-year-old boy as 5(3x). We know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 years older than the",

Since the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 1-year-old brother as x. Then, the height of the 3-year-old brother is 3x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 5-year-old boy as 5(3x) = 15x. We know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 years older than the 3-year-old boy, so we can set up the equation: 15x - 3x = 5x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, we can set up the equation: 15x = 5x + x. Solving for x, we get: 15x = 5x + x, 15x = 6x, 9x = 0, x = 0. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our equations. Let's try again. Since the 3-year-old boy is 3 times as tall as his 1-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 1-year-old brother as x. Then, the height of the 3-year-old brother is 3x. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 5-year-old boy as 5(3x) = 15x. We know that the 5-year-old boy is 5 years older than the 3",

Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, we can represent the height of the 5-year-old boy as 5(3x) = 15x. We are given that the 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother, so we can set up the equation: 15x = 5(3x) + x. Solving for x, we get: 15x = 15x + x, which simplifies to: 0 = x.

If the boy's height is 36 inches, what is the boy's height in inches?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nTo find the boy's height, we can set up a proportion using the information that the boy's height is 5 times his brother's height. Let's call the boy's height \"x\" and the brother's height \"y\". We know that x = 5y. We also know that x = 36 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 5y = 36. Solving for y, we get: y = 36 / 5 = 7.2. Now that we know the brother's height, we can find the boy's height: x = 5y = 5(7.2) = 36. Therefore, the boy's height is 36 inches.
