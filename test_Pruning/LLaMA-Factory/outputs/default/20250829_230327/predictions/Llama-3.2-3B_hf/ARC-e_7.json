The more massive a star is, the hotter it is, and the more massive it is, the more likely it will have a similar chemical composition to other massive stars. The distance from Earth does not affect the chemical composition of a star, but it does affect its brightness. The temperature of a star is determined by its chemical composition, but it is not directly related to its mass or distance from Earth. The brightness of a star is determined by its mass and distance from Earth. However, the mass of a star is not directly related to its chemical composition.
