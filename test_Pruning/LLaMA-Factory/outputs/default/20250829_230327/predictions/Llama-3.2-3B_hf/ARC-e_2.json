Which difference between these two layers of Earth resulted in their differentiation?\nA. age\nB. velocity\nC. viscosity\nD. density\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The difference between the mantle and the outer core is that the mantle is made of silicate and magnesium oxide rocks, while the outer core is made of liquid iron and nickel. The liquid iron and nickel outer core has a lower density than the mantle, which means that the outer core is lighter than the mantle. This is because the density of a substance is inversely proportional to its mass, and the mass of the outer core is less than the mass of the mantle.
