        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: A genetic mutation is an alteration in the DNA of a gene. This can cause a change in the shape of the butterfly's wings. Speciation is a process of evolution that occurs when a new species emerges from a single ancestor. An adaptation is a change in the way a species responds to an environment. Natural selection is the process by which organisms compete for resources and pass on traits to their offspring. Speciation, adaptation, and natural selection are all processes that can cause changes in the shape of the butterfly's wings. However, a genetic mutation is the most likely cause of this change because it is a random alteration in the DNA of a gene, which can result in a change in the shape of the butterfly's wings.
