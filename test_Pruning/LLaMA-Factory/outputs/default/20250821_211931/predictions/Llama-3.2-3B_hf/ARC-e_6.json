This means that the impact effects increase the weight of the worker by 25 percent of 180 lbs. and 200 lbs. respectively.\n25% of 180 lbs. is 45 lbs.\n25% of 200 lbs. is 50 lbs.\nSo the impact effects increase the weight of the two workers by 45 lbs and 50 lbs respectively.\nThe resultant maximum live load is the sum of the original weight and the increase due to impact effects.\nThe original weight of the two workers is 180 lbs + 200 lbs = 380 lbs.\nThe increase due to impact effects is 45 lbs + 50 lbs = 95 lbs.\nThe resultant maximum live load is 380 lbs + 95 lbs = 475 lbs.\nThe answer is \\boxed{B}.

This is because the waves will be reflected off of the bottom of the water, which will cause them to slow down. Similarly, when the waves pass through rock, they will slow down due to the rock's ability to reflect the waves.
