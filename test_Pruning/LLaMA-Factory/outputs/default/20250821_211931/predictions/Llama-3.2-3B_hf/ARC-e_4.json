        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: A single human body cell typically contains thousands of genes. The number of genes in a cell is determined by the number of times the cell cycle completes in a given time period. The cell cycle is a process that allows a cell to divide into two new daughter cells. Each cell cycle can result in one new cell, which can then divide into two new cells, resulting in a total of 2^2 = 4 new cells. Since the cell cycle can occur multiple times, the total number of cells that can be produced from a single cell is 2^n, where n is the number of times the cell cycle occurs. Since a single human body cell typically contains thousands of genes, we can set up the equation 2^n = 1000, where n is the number of times the cell cycle occurs. Solving for n, we get n = 10. Therefore, a single human body cell typically contains 2^10 = 1024 genes.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]",
