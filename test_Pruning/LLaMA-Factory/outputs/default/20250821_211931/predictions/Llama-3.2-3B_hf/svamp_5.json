If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of boys as x. Since there are 868 girls, the number of boys is 868 - x. According to the problem, there are 281 more girls than boys, so we can write the equation: 868 - x = x + 281. Solving for x, we get 2x = 868 - 281 = 587. Therefore, x = 587 / 2 = 293.5. Since the number of boys must be a whole number, we round x to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that x = 293.5 is not a whole number, but x = 293 is a whole number and 868 - 293 = 575, which is less than 587. So, x = 293 is a possible solution.

If there are 142 more boys than girls How many pupils are there in that school?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of girls as x. Since there are 700 girls, x = 700. The number of boys is 142 more than the number of girls, so the number of boys is x + 142. Therefore, the total number of pupils is x + (x + 142) = 2x + 142. Since we know that the total number of pupils is 700, we can set up the equation 2x + 142 = 700. Solving for x, we get 2x = 700 - 142 = 558. Therefore, x = 279. So the number of girls is 279 and the number of boys is 279 + 142 = 421. The total number of pupils is 279 + 421 = 700.
