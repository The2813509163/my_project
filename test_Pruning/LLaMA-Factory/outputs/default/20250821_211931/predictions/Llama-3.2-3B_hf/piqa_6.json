Lower heat to medium and continue to gently boil; the milk proteins will break apart.        5.

In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat.        2.    Continue to cook over medium-high heat; an even layer of white milk proteins will float to the surface.        3.    Bring to a boil; the milk proteins will become foamy.        4.    Lower heat to medium and continue to gently boil; the milk proteins will break apart.        5.    As the butter gently boils, the milk proteins will eventually sink to the bottom of the pot, and the boiling will begin to calm and then cease. Adjust heat as needed to continue boiling off the water without scorching the milk solids.        6.    Once boiling has stopped, pour butter through a cheesecloth-lined strainer or through a coffee filter into a heatproof container to remove browned milk solids.
