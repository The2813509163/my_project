According to the problem, there are 228 more girls than boys, so we can write the equation: 697 - x = x + 228. Solving for x, we get 697 - x = x + 228, which simplifies to 2x = 469, and finally x = 234.5. Since the number of boys cannot be a fraction, we made a mistake somewhere. Let's re-examine the equation: 697 - x = x + 228. We can rewrite it as 697 - 228 = x + x, which simplifies to 469 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 234.5. However, we know that the number of boys must be a whole number. Let's try again. We can rewrite the equation as 697 - x = x + 228, which can be rewritten as 697 - 228 = x + x, which simplifies to 469 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 234.5.

We know that the total number of bottles is 4, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 79) = 4. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 79 = 4. Subtracting 79 from both sides, we get 2x = -75. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = -37.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a bottle, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, the number of bottles of regular soda is 37. The answer is 37.\n\nQuestion: The number of books in the library is 100.

How many apples does He have?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. We know that A + J = 7. We also know that Adam has 9 apples more than Jackie, so A = J + 9. We can substitute A = J + 9 into the first equation to get J + 9 + J = 7, which simplifies to 2J = -2, and finally J = -1. However, since we can't have a negative number of apples, we made a mistake somewhere. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Adam has 7 apples and Jackie has 9 apples. So, together they have 7 + 9 = 16 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, so he has 16 + 9 = 25 apples.
