        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The answer is A, because you need to give the company your card information before they deliver the pizza. This is the safest way to pay for the pizza, because if the company does not deliver the pizza, you will not have paid for it. If you give the company your cash before they deliver, you will have paid for the pizza, but if the company does not deliver, you will have wasted your money. So, the safest way to pay for the pizza is to give the company your card information before they deliver.",

        "origin_prompt": "Is there a best way to blow up party balloons?\nA. Before a birthday party or other affair requiring large numbers of inflated balloons, it is helpful to have a dozen or so blowers arrive early. Give each one a handful, depending on how many you need, and then return to the kitchen to continue getting food ready. At least one person will know how to do it right, so they will all eventually figure it out.\nB. Invite 10 or 12 kids over half an hour before the party starts. With them watching, blow up a couple of balloons but tell the kids  they aren't allowed to touch them. Then, leave a box of pins on the table and say \"and don't touch these either\" very clearly. Leave the room until you hear the popping sounds.  When you come back in, tell them if they want balloons at the party they're the ones who have to blow them up. You'll have a roomful in about 10 minutes flat.\nAnswer:",
