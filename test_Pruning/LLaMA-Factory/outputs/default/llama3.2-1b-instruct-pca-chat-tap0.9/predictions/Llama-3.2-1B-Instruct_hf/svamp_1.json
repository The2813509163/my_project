However, the question asks for the number of shelves, so we round down to 0 full shelves and 0 shelves with 8/10 of a shelf. But since the question asks for the number of shelves, we can assume that the 8/10 of a shelf is actually a shelf with 8 action figures, and the remaining 2/10 of a shelf is actually a shelf with 2 action figures.

We also know that Adam has 9 more apples than Jackie, so A = K + 9. Substituting A = K + 9 into the first equation, we get (K + 9) + K = 12, which simplifies to 2K + 9 = 12. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us 2K = 3. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us K = 1.5. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, this means that Adam has 1 apple and Jackie has 11 apples.

So, the amount she collected at the ATM minus the amount she spent at the supermarket is 49 - x. Since we know that she collected 49 dollars at the ATM, we can set up the equation: 49 - x = 49.
