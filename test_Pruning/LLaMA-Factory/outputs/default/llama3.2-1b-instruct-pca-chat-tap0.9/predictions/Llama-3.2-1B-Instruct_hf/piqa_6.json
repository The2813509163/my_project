Spoon a few tablespoons cottage cheese and 1 tablespoon jam onto each one. Roll into cones.\n\n2. To make the cones, you can use the pancake mix as the dough for the cones. The dough will be in a cylindrical shape, and the cones will be formed by cutting the dough into sections.\n\n3. To cut the dough into sections, you can use a ruler to divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Each part will be a cone with a base radius of 3 inches and a height of 1 inch.\n\n4. To find the volume of each cone, you can use the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (1/3)πr^2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.\n\n5. Plugging in the values, you get: V = (1/3)π(3)^2(1) = (1/3)π(9)(1) = 3π/3 = π.\n\n6. Since the volume of each cone is π, you can make 6 cones by stacking them on top of each other.\n\n7. To find the total volume of the cones, you can multiply the volume of each cone by the number of cones: 6π.\n\n8.
