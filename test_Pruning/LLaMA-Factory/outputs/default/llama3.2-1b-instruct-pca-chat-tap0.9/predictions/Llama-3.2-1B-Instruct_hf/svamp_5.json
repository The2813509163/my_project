Since 46 campers went rowing in the morning, the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is 46 - x. We know that the total number of campers is 46, so we can set up the equation: 46 = 43 + (46 - x). Solving for x, we get: 46 - 43 = 46 - x, which simplifies to 3 = 46 - x. Subtracting 46 from both sides gives us: -43 = -x. Multiplying both sides by -1 gives us: x = 43. Therefore, 43 campers went rowing in the afternoon. The answer is \\boxed{43}.",

This means that 43 crayons were either given away or lost. Since we can't have a negative number of crayons, this means that 43 crayons were lost or given away. However, the question asks how many crayons had been lost or given away, so we need to subtract the number of crayons that were given away from the total number of crayons. Since we don't know how many crayons were given away, we can't determine the exact number of crayons that were lost or given away. However, we can say that 43 crayons were lost or given away.
