Oxygen has the greatest effect on the weather conditions associated with an air mass.\n\nExplanation:\nOxygen is a gas that is present in the atmosphere, and its presence affects the temperature and pressure of the air. The presence of oxygen has a significant impact on the weather, particularly in terms of temperature and pressure. In general, the presence of oxygen results in a warmer temperature and a lower pressure, which can lead to colder weather conditions.\n\nThe other gases listed in the options (nitrogen, methane, water vapor) do not have the same effect on the weather conditions as oxygen.
