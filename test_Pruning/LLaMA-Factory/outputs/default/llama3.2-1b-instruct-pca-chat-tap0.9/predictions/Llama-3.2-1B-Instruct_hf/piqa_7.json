This mixture is then stored in a container with a specific level of water coverage, which is determined by the amount of acorns and the amount of water in the container.\n\nTo create a natural lempenée, you need to use the acorns to create a mixture of acorns and water, and then store this mixture in a container with a specific level of water coverage.

There are several methods to cook chicken, but the most common ones are:\n\n    *   **Grinding**: Grind the chicken to ensure it is fully cooked. This can be done by using a food blender or using the following method: Place the chicken in a bowl and pound it gently. This method results in a soft and even texture.\n\n    *   **Browning**: Brown the chicken by cooking it in the oven. This can be done by placing the chicken in the oven and cooking it until it is brown. This method results in a slightly different texture.\n\n3.  **Check for color**: After cooking, check the color of the chicken. If it is not brown, it needs to be cooked further.\n\n4.  **Check for moisture**: Check the moisture of the chicken.
