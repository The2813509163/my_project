Since there are 12 children on the bus, and 68 children got off, the number of children who got off the bus is 68. The number of children who got on the bus is 12. To find the difference, we subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the number of children who got off the bus: 68 - 12 = 56. Therefore, 56 more children got off the bus than those who got on the bus.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{56}.",

Doug lost some marbles, so Ed now has x + 2 - y marbles, where y is the number of marbles Doug lost. We are given that Ed now has 19 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up the equation: x + 2 - y = x + 19. Simplifying the equation, we get 2 - y = 19, which implies y = -17. However, since we cannot have a negative number of marbles, this is not a valid solution. Therefore, we re-examine our previous equation: x + 2 - y = x + 19. We can rewrite this equation as 2 - y = 19 - x. Since x and y are non-negative integers, we can try different values of x to find a solution. If x = 0, then 2 - y = 19 - 0, which implies y = -17, which is not a valid solution. If x = 1, then 2 - y = 19 - 1, which implies y = -16, which is also not a valid solution. If x = 2, then 2 - y = 19 - 2, which implies y = -15, which is not a valid solution. If x = 3, then 2 - y = 19 - 3, which implies y = -14, which is not a valid solution. If x = 4, then 2 - y = 19 - 4, which implies y = -13, which is not a valid solution. If x = 5, then 2 - y = 19 - 5, which implies y = -12, which is not a valid solution. If x = 6, then 2 - y = 19 - 6, which implies y = -11, which is not a valid solution. If x = 7, then 2 - y = 19 - 7, which implies y = -10, which is not a valid solution. If x = 8, then 2 - y = 19 - 8, which implies y = -7, which is not a valid solution. If x = 9, then 2 - y = 19 - 9, which implies y = -6",
