It is not directly related to the measurement of electricity in kilowatt-hours.\n\nD. Thermal expansion is defined as the change in the volume of a substance when heated. It is not directly related to the measurement of electricity in kilowatt-hours.\n\nHowever, there is a unit that is closely related to the measurement of electricity in kilowatt-hours. The unit is actually jouel, which is defined as the energy transferred through a fluid when it is displaced.
