This is because the reactivity of the nut or bolt is primarily due to the presence of the nut or bolt material itself, not to the chemical properties of the material.\n\nWhen a nut or bolt is sprayed with glue, the glue will adhere to the nut or bolt material, but it will not change the color or chemical reactivity of the nut or bolt. Therefore, spraying the nut or bolt with glue does not change its reactivity.\n\nSimilarly, when a nut or bolt is greased lightly, the grease will adhere to the nut or bolt material, but it will not change the color or chemical reactivity of the nut or bolt. Therefore, greasing the nut or bolt lightly does not change its reactivity.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is that both A and B are correct, but the question asks for a single answer.
