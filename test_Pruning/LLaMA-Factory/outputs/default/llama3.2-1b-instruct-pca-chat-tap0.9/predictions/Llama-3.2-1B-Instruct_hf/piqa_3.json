This means we need to cover the entire length and width of the balloon with the small piece of paper.\n\nTo find the number of layers needed, we can divide the length of the balloon (2 layers) by the length of the small piece of paper (0.75 inches), and the width of the balloon (2 layers) by the width of the small piece of paper (0.75 inches).\n\nLet's calculate the number of layers needed:\n\nLength of balloon: 2 layers\nLength of small piece of paper: 0.75 inches\nWidth of balloon: 2 layers\nWidth of small piece of paper: 0.75 inches\n\nNumber of layers needed: (2 layers) / (0.75 inches) + (2 layers) / (0.75 inches) = 2.67 + 2.67 = 5.33\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a layer, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
