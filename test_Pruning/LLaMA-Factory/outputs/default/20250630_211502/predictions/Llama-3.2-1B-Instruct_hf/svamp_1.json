We are given that there are 15 different books and 40 different movies. We are also given that you read 11 of the books and watched 40 of the movies. We can use this information to find the number of books and movies in the'crazy silly school'series.\n\nLet's assume that the number of movies in the'crazy silly school'series is x. Then, the number of movies you watched is 40. Since you watched 40 movies, the number of movies in the'crazy silly school'series is x = 40.\n\nNow, let's assume that the number of books in the'crazy silly school'series is y. Then, the number of books you read is 11. Since you read 11 books, the number of books in the'crazy silly school'series is y = 11.\n\nWe can now use the fact that the total number of books and movies in the'crazy silly school'series is equal to the total number of books and movies in the'crazy silly school'series. We can set up the equation:\n\ny + x = 15 + 40\n\nSubstituting the values we found earlier, we get:\n\n11 + 40 = 51\n\nThis equation is not true, which means that our assumption that the number of movies in the'crazy silly school'series is x and the number of books in the'crazy silly school'series is y is incorrect.\n\nLet's try again. We are given that you read 11 of the books and watched 40 of the movies. We can assume that the number of books in the'crazy silly school'series is y. Then, the number of movies in the'crazy silly school'series is x = 40.\n\nWe can now use the fact that the total number of books and movies in the'crazy silly school'series is equal to the total number of books and movies in the'crazy silly school'series. We can set up the equation:\n\ny + x = 15 + 40\n\nSubstituting the values we found earlier, we get:\n\ny + 40 = 55\n\nSubtracting 40 from both sides, we get:\n\ny = 15\n\nNow, we can find the number of movies in the'crazy silly school'series:\n\nx = 40\n\nWe can now find the number of books",

Lucy bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake, for a total of 14 packs. She had 56 amount of change remaining, so she must have spent 14 * 2 = 28 dollars on cookies and 12 * 2 = 24 dollars on cake. In total, she spent 28 + 24 = 52 dollars. Since she had 56 amount of change remaining, she must have bought 52 / 56 = 0.929 or 92.29 packs of groceries. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round down to 92 packs.
