However, we can still solve the problem by assuming that the question meant to ask how many crunches David did in total, not just the number of crunches he did in gym class. Let's assume that David did x crunches in total. We know that David did 17 less crunches than Zachary, so x = 34 - 17 = 17. Therefore, David did 17 crunches in total. The answer is \\boxed{17}.",
