After deleting 18 apps, he had x - 18 apps left. Since he had 5 apps left, we can set up the equation: x - 18 = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 23. Therefore, Dave had 23 apps on his phone at the start.

Then, the number of peaches Jake has is x - 12. Since the total number of peaches is 18, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x - 12) = 18\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x - 12 = 18\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n2x = 30\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 15\n\nSo, Jill has 15 peaches.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{15}.",
