Selective breeding.\n\nSelective breeding is a process where a group of people is selected and then paired with a group of people to determine the selection process. This is a common concept in sports and other related fields.\n\nIn this case, the transfer of a section of DNA from one organism into the DNA of another organism is a selective breeding process.
