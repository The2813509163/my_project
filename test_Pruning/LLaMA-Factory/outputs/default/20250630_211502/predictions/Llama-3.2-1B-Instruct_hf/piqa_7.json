This means that the mixture will be baked with the yeast at a certain temperature.\n\nThe oven is typically preheated to a temperature that is slightly above the temperature at which the yeast will be present in the mixture. Since the yeast is present in the mixture at a temperature that is slightly above 60 degrees, the oven should be preheated to a temperature that is slightly above 60 degrees.\n\nThe preheated oven is typically preheated to a temperature that is slightly above 60 degrees, so the baking time for the semolina-coconut mixture will be between 35 to 45 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{35 to 45} \\]",
