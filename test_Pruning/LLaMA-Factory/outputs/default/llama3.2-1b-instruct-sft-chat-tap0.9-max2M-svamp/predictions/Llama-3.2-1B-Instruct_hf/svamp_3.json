Instead, she cut some roses from the 14 that she had. Let's assume she cut x roses from the 14. Then, the number of roses she has now is 13 - x + 14 = 27 - x. We know that she has 91 orchids, so the number of roses she has now is also equal to 91. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 27 - x = 91. Solving for x, we get x = 64. However, this is the number of roses she cut from the 14 that she had. Since she had 13 roses initially, she must have cut 64 - 13 = 51 roses from the 14 that she had.
