Since she can't bake a negative number of cookies, this means she baked 27 fewer chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies yesterday. \n\nHowever, the question asks how many chocolate chip cookies she baked, not how many fewer cookies she baked. Since she baked 27 fewer cookies yesterday, she must have baked 27 fewer chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies this morning. \n\nBut the question asks for the number of chocolate chip cookies she baked, not the number of raisin cookies she baked. Since she baked 86 raisin cookies this morning, she must have baked 86 - 27 = 59 chocolate chip cookies yesterday. \n\nSo, Helen baked 59 chocolate chip cookies yesterday. \n\nThe answer is \\boxed{59}.",

Since she can't have a negative amount of sugar, this means she needs to add more sugar than salt. However, the question asks how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add, so we need to subtract the amount of sugar she already put in from the total amount of sugar needed: 7 - 5 = 2. Therefore, Mary needs to add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of salt, but the question asks how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add.

To find the number of crayons lost, we subtract the number of crayons he had left from the total number of crayons he had initially: 544 - 492 = 52. However, this is the number of crayons he gave away, not the number of crayons lost. Since he gave away 52 crayons, and he had 492 crayons left, the number of crayons lost is 492 - 52 = 440.

To find the number of roses she cut, we subtract the number of roses she put in the vase (17) from the number of roses she threw away (33) and then take the absolute value of the result: |-33 - 17| = 50. Since she cut more roses than she threw away, the correct answer is that she cut 50 more roses than she threw away.
