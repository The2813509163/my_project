        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The strength of a magnet is defined as the force it can exert on an object. When a magnet is used to lift metal paper clips, the force exerted is equal to the mass of the paper clips times the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 32 m/s^2). Therefore, the strength of the magnet is equal to the mass of the paper clips times the acceleration due to gravity. This is the same as option A.",
