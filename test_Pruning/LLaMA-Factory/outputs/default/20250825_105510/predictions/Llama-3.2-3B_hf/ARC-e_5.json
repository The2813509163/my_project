        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The Moon's gravitational pull is the primary factor that causes ocean tides. When the Moon is at a position that aligns with the direction of the tide, it pulls on the water, causing it to rise or fall. This is because the Moon's gravitational force is the primary factor that causes the water to rise or fall.",

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The latitude of a region determines the angle of sunlight throughout the year, which in turn affects the climate by determining how much of the sun's energy is absorbed by the land. The longer the length of days throughout the year, the more energy the land can absorb, which in turn affects the climate by increasing the amount of energy the land can absorb. This is because the longer the length of days, the more time the sun is shining, which means the land is absorbing more energy, which in turn means the climate is warmer. Therefore, the latitude of a region affects its climate by determining the angle of sunlight throughout the year, which in turn affects the climate by increasing the amount of energy the land can absorb. This is because the longer the length of days, the more energy the land can absorb, which in turn affects the climate by increasing the amount of energy the land can absorb.
