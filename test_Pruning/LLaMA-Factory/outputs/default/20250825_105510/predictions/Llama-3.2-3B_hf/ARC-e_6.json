To find the new live load, we need to calculate 25% of the original weight and add it to the original weight.\n\n25% of 180 lbs. = 0.25 x 180 = 45 lbs.\nNew live load = 180 lbs. + 45 lbs. = 225 lbs.\n\nSince there are two workers, the resultant maximum live load is twice the new live load:\n2 x 225 lbs. = 450 lbs.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\boxed{B}",

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The water cycle consists of two main parts: precipitation and transpiration. Precipitation is the part of the water cycle where water is lost as it falls from the sky. Transpiration is the part of the water cycle where water is lost as it moves through the soil and into the ground. Both of these parts are involved in the formation of sinkholes and caves. Precipitation is the part of the water cycle that is lost as water falls from the sky.

This is because the soil can break down into smaller particles, which can then be used to form new magma. This can cause more volcanos to erupt, which can increase the amount of seismic activity in the region. This is because the increased number of volcanos can cause more earthquakes to occur, which can increase the amount of seismic activity in the region. This is because the increased number of earthquakes can cause more earthquakes to occur, which can increase the amount of seismic activity in the region. Therefore, forest fires can cause more seismic activity in the region, which can increase the amount of soil available for the formation of new volcanos. This can cause more volcanos to erupt, which can increase the amount of seismic activity in the region. This is the correct answer. Forest fires can cause more seismic activity in the region, which can increase the amount of soil available for the formation of new volcanos.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The answer is A. Air vibrations allow two students standing ten feet apart to hear each other talk. The reason is that sound waves travel at a speed of 1,000,000 miles per second, and the distance between the two students is 10 feet, which is 10,000 feet. Since the speed of sound is 1,000,000 miles per second, the time it takes for a sound wave to travel 10,000 feet is 10,000/1,000,000 = 0.01 seconds. This means that the two students will hear each other talk 10,000/1,000,000 = 0.01 seconds later. Since the time it takes for a sound wave to travel 10,000 feet is 0.01 seconds, the two students will hear each other talk 10,000/0.01 = 1,000,000 times faster than the speed of sound. This means that the two students will hear each other talk 10,000/1,000,000 = 0.01 seconds later, which is equivalent to 10,000/1,000,000 = 0.01 seconds. Since the two students are standing ten feet apart, the air vibrations will allow them to hear each other talk. The answer is A. Air vibrations allow two students standing ten feet apart to hear each other talk.
