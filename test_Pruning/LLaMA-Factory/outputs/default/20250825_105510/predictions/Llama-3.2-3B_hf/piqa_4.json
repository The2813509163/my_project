This is a matter of personal preference, as canned jalapenos are often more likely to be available than fresh jalapenos. However, it is also possible that canned jalapenos are more likely to be available in the long term, as they are more likely to be available in bulk, and it is less likely that a person will have a fresh jalapeno on hand than that they will have a canned jalapeno.

This is because the ice water will stop the cooking process, and the asparagus will remain in a state that is similar to the state it was in when it was removed from the water.
