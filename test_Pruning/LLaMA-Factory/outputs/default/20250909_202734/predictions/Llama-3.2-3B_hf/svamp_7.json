How many sacks of ripe oranges will they have after 73 days of harvest?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's break down the problem into two parts: the number of unripe oranges and the number of ripe oranges.\nThe number of unripe oranges harvested per day is 25 sacks.\nThe number of ripe oranges harvested per day is 5 sacks.\nThe total number of oranges harvested per day is 25 + 5 = 30 sacks.\nSince the oranges are harvested for 73 days, the total number of oranges harvested is 30 * 73 = 2190 sacks.\nSince the oranges are organized into 87 oranges and 290 bananas, the number of unripe oranges is 2190 - 290 = 1890.\nThe number of ripe oranges is 5 sacks per day.\nSo the number of ripe oranges after 73 days is 5 * 73 = 365 sacks.\nThus, the total number of oranges after 73 days is 1890 + 365 = 2255.\nThus, the number of sacks of ripe oranges after 73 days is 365.\nThus, the answer is \\boxed{365}.

How many apples were there on all trees initially?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the initial number of apples on each tree as x. \nThen the total number of apples on all trees initially is 3*x. \nSince Rachel picked 8 apples from each of her trees, the total number of apples she picked is 3*8 = 24. \nSo the total number of apples on all trees initially minus the number of apples she picked is 3*x - 24. \nSince the trees now have a total of 9 apples, this number is equal to 3*x - 24. \nThus, 3*x - 24 = 9. \nAdding 24 to both sides, we get 3*x = 33. \nDividing both sides by 3, we get x = 11. \nSo the initial number of apples on each tree is 11. \nThus, the total number of apples on all trees initially is 3*11 = 33. \nThe answer is \\boxed{33}.

Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of children that got off the bus as x. Then the number of children that got on the bus is 12 - x. We know that the total number of children on the bus is 36 + 68 = 104. So we can write the equation: 36 + x + (12 - x) = 104. Simplifying the equation, we get 48 + 12 = 104. This equation is always true, which means that the number of children that got off the bus (x) can be any number. However, we are asked to find the difference between the number of children that got off the bus and those that got on. Since the number of children that got on the bus is 12 - x, the difference is x - (12 - x) = x - 12 + x = 2x - 12. Since x can be any number, the difference can be any number. However, we can see that the difference is always positive, since x is a positive number (number of children that got off the bus). Therefore, the difference is always greater than 12. But we are asked to find the difference, so we need to find the smallest possible value of x. Since x is a positive number, the smallest possible value of x is 1. Therefore, the difference is 2x - 12 = 2(1) - 12 = -10. However, the difference cannot be negative, since it is the difference between the number of children that got off the bus and those that got on. Therefore, the difference is always positive, and the smallest possible value of the difference is 1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}. Question: 36 children were riding on the bus.
