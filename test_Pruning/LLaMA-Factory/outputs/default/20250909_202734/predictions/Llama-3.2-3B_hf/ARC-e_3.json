        "prediction": " B. Chromosomes must be copied.\nThe cell division is a process that involves the formation of two daughter cells. This process is initiated by the division of the chromosomes, which results in the formation of two daughter cells. The chromosomes are duplicated before the cell division. This is because the division of chromosomes results in the formation of two daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the original cell. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Chromosomes must be copied.\nThe correct answer is B. Chromosomes must be copied.\nThe correct answer is B. Chromosomes must be copied.\nThe correct answer is B.
