        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The existence of a rift valley is a characteristic of a region where two plates have diverged. This is because the valley is formed by the separation of the two plates, and the valley is a deep, narrow valley that is not filled with water. The presence of a rift valley is indicated by the presence of a valley in the satellite image. The answer is C.",

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The laser is the device that produces light energy. The laser produces light energy by using the energy of the electron beam to produce a light beam. The radio, toaster, and microwave all produce heat energy, not light energy. The laser produces light energy, which is produced by the energy of the electron beam.
