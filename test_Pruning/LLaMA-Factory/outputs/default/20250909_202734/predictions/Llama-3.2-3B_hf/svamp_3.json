How many peaches does Jake have?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as x. Then Jake has x + 67. Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, Steven has x + 67 + 4 = x + 71. We know that Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, so x + 71 = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 12 - 71 = -59. But x cannot be negative since it represents the number of peaches. This means that our initial assumption that Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem. Let's denote the number of peaches Jake has as y. Then Steven has y + 67. Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, we can set up the equation y + 67 = 12 + 67 - 4. Simplifying this equation, we get y + 67 = 75. Solving for y, we get y = 75 - 67 = 8.
