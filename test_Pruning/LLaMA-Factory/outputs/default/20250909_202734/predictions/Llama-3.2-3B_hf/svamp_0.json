        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff as x. \nThen the number of Ace cards she gave to Jeff is 356 - x. \nAfter giving away some cards, Nell has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. \nSo 309 - x + 356 - x = 415. \nCombining like terms we get 665 - 2x = 415. \nAdding 2x to both sides we get 665 = 415 + 2x. \nSubtracting 415 from both sides we get 250 = 2x. \nDividing both sides by 2 we get x = 125. \nSo Nell gave away 125 Ace cards. \nNow we can find the number of Ace cards Nell has left: 356 - 125 = 231. \nThe difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has is 415 - 231 = 184. \nThus, Nell has \\boxed{184} more baseball cards than Ace cards.

If there are 228 more girls than boys How many boys are there in that school?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of boys as x. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, the number of girls is x + 228. We know that the total number of students is 697, so the sum of the number of girls and boys is equal to 697. Therefore, we can write the equation x + (x + 228) = 697. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 228 = 697. Subtracting 228 from both sides, we get 2x = 469. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 234.5. Since the number of boys must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer. Therefore, there are 234 boys in the school.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
