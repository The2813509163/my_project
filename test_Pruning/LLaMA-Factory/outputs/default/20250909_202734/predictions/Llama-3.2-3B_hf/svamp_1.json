How many more apps than files does he have left on the phone?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " \nLet's denote the number of apps Dave deleted as x. Then the number of apps he has left is 15 - x. \nSimilarly, let's denote the number of files Dave deleted as y. Then the number of files he has left is 24 - y. \nWe are given that Dave has 21 apps and 4 files left. \nSo 15 - x = 21 and 24 - y = 4. \nSolving these equations we get x = 6 and y = 20. \nSo Dave has 21 - 6 = 15 apps left and 4 - 20 = -16 files left. \nSince the number of files cannot be negative, this means that Dave has 0 files left. \nSo Dave has 15 - 0 = 15 more apps than files left on the phone. \nThe answer is \\boxed{15}. Question: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups How big is each group of bananas? Let's think step by step Answer: To find the size of each group of bananas, we divide the total number of bananas (290) by the number of groups (2): 290 / 2 = 145.

Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as x. We know that he had 29 bottle caps initially and 42 bottle caps now. So the number of bottle caps he added is 42 - 29 = 13. We also know that he had 82 wrappers initially and 61 wrappers now. So the number of wrappers he added is 61 - 82 = -21. Since we cannot have a negative number of wrappers, this means that the initial number of wrappers is actually 82 - 61 = 21. Now we can set up an equation to represent the situation: x + 13 = 42. Solving for x, we get x = 29. Therefore, Danny had 29 bottle caps initially.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.

        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A, the number of apples Jackie has as J, and the number of apples He has as H. We know that A + J + H = 12. We also know that H = A + 9 and H = J + 8. We can use these two equations to solve for A and J. From the first equation, we have H = 12 - A - J. Substituting H = A + 9 into this equation, we get 12 - A - J = A + 9. Solving for J, we get J = 3. Now that we know J, we can find A using the equation H = A + 9. Substituting J = 3 into this equation, we get H = A + 9. Substituting H = 12 - A - J into this equation, we get 12 - A - 3 = A + 9. Solving for A, we get A = 6.

How many apples did the tree have to begin with?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the initial number of apples on the tree as x. We know that 7 apples were picked and 2 new apples grew, so the total number of apples is x + 7 + 2 = x + 9. We also know that the tree now has 6 apples left, so x + 9 = 6. Therefore, x = -3. However, the number of apples cannot be negative, so we need to re-evaluate our assumptions. Let's assume that the 2 new apples grew on the tree, and the 7 apples were picked from the tree. This means that the tree now has 6 - 7 + 2 = (-1) + 2 = 1 apple left. Therefore, the tree had 1 + 7 = 8 apples to begin with. The answer is 8.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.

Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of children that got off the bus as x. Then the number of children that got on the bus is 82 - x. We know that the total number of children on the bus is 30. So we can write the equation: 28 + (82 - x) = 30. Solving for x, we get 82 - x = 30 - 28 = 2. Therefore, x = 82 - 2 = 80. So 80 children got off the bus and 82 - 80 = 2 more children got on the bus than those that got off. The answer is 2.\n\nQuestion: There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection.
