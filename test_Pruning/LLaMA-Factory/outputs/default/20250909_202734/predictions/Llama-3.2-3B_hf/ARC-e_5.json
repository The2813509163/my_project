What could scientists compare between pandas and the raccoons to help classify the panda more accurately?\nA. their diets\nB. their DNA\nC. their body sizes\nD. their geographic distribution\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The question is asking for a comparison between pandas and raccoons that could help classify the panda more accurately. The comparison of diets is a good choice because pandas and raccoons are both herbivores (they eat only plants), and their diets are likely to be similar. The comparison of DNA is also a good choice because pandas and raccoons are both mammals, and their DNA is likely to be similar. The comparison of body sizes is a good choice because pandas and raccoons are both mammals, and their body sizes are likely to be similar. The comparison of geographic distribution is a good choice because pandas and raccoons are both mammals, and their geographic distribution is likely to be similar.

The glass window is made of transparent material, so it does not refract light rays. None of the above objects refracts light rays. The correct answer is none of the above. The correct answer is that the object that refracts light rays is the object that is not transparent. The transparent objects are glass, cardboard, and aluminum.
