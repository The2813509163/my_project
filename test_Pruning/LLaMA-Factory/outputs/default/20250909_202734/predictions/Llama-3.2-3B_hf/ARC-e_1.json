        "prediction": " C\nExplanation: The roller coaster will stop when the friction force is equal to the force of gravity acting on the roller coaster. The friction force is equal to the force of friction, which is the product of the normal force and the coefficient of friction. The normal force is the force acting on the roller coaster to keep it on the track, which is equal to the weight of the roller coaster. The coefficient of friction is less than 1, so the friction force is less than the weight of the roller coaster. Therefore, the friction force is less than the force of gravity acting on the roller coaster. The roller coaster will stop when the friction force is equal to the force of gravity acting on the roller coaster. Therefore, the roller coaster will stop when the friction force is equal to the force of gravity acting on the roller coaster.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: Adaptation is a process of change in the behavior of a species, which is not necessarily a response to a specific stimulus. Migration is a process of movement from one place to another. Hibernation is a process of remaining in a state of non-reactivity, which is a response to a specific stimulus. Camels have humps on their backs that store fat, allowing them to survive for many days without food. This makes camels well suited to desert life. This characteristic is an example of adaptation.
