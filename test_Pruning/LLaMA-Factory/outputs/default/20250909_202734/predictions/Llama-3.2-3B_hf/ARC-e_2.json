        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: The fossil record of a plant species is the best way to determine the changes in a plant species over geologic time. This is because the fossil record is the only way to see how the plant species evolved over a long period of time. Examining the type of seeds the plant produces, examining the type of animals that eat the plant, and examining the number of plants in a given area would all be less helpful in determining the changes in a plant species over geologic time. This is because these methods would only give a limited view of the evolution of the plant species over a relatively short period of time, and would not provide a comprehensive view of the evolution of the plant species over a long period of time.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]",
