There are 87 oranges. The problem states that the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups. Therefore, the total number of groups is 2 + 93 = 95. Since there are 87 oranges, each group must contain 87 / 95 = 0.9 or 0.9 * 100 = 90 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 90 / 7 = 12.86 or 12.86 * 100 = 1296 oranges. Since there are 14 slices in each pizza, each pizza must contain 1296 / 14 = 92.86 or 92.86 * 100 = 923 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 923 / 7 = 132.86 or 132.86 * 100 = 13286 oranges. Since there are 87 oranges, each group must contain 87 / 132.86 = 0.66 or 0.66 * 100 = 66 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 66 / 7 = 9 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 9 * 7 = 63 oranges. Since there are 87 oranges, each group must contain 87 / 63 = 1.41 or 1.41 * 100 = 141 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 141 / 7 = 20 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 20 * 7 = 140 oranges. Since there are 87 oranges, each group must contain 87 / 140 = 0.62 or 0.62 * 100 = 62 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 62 / 7 = 8.86 or 8.86 * 100 = 886 oranges. Since there are 7 pizzas, each pizza must contain 886 / 7 = 101.14 or 101.14 * 100 = 10114 oranges. Since there are 87 oranges, each group must contain 87 / 10114 = 0.",
