Here's the solution:\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking for a way to reduce calories by cutting Knowledge Date.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given information\nThe problem states that the date is 27 Jun 2025, but it does not specify the exact date before bedtime. However, it does mention that the date is not a multiple of 24 hours.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the reduction in calories\nTo reduce calories, we need to reduce the amount of water in the water. Since the water is not specified, we cannot assume that the reduction is proportional to the time. However, we can assume that the reduction is proportional to the number of hours.\n\n## Step 4: Find the number of hours before bedtime\nSince the date is 27 Jun 2025, which is 3 hours after the initial 2023, we can assume that the reduction in calories will be proportional to 3 hours.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the reduction in calories\nIf we assume that the reduction in calories is proportional to 3 hours, then we can calculate the reduction in calories as follows:\nReduction in calories = (3 hours / 24 hours) x 27 Jun 2025\nReduction in calories = (1/8) x 27\nReduction in calories = 3.375\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.375}$",
