Therefore, he spends a total of 9 + 13 = 22 hours on learning English and 4 + 22 = 26 hours on learning Chinese. Since there are 6 days in a week, he spends a total of 6 * 22 = 132 hours on learning English and 6 * 26 = 156 hours on learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 132 + 156 = 288 hours on learning English and 4 + 288 = 292 hours on learning Chinese. Since there are 6 days in a month, he spends a total of 6 * 288 = 1728 hours on learning English and 6 * 292 = 1744 hours on learning Chinese. Since there are 6 days in a week, he spends a total of 6 * 1728 = 10368 hours on learning English and 6 * 1744 = 10368 hours on learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends a total of 10368 + 10368 = 20736 hours on learning English and 4 * 1744 = 6912 hours on learning Chinese.

If they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, they sold 242 - 115 = 127 t-shirts during the Texas tech game. The answer is 127. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 127 / 242 = 0.525. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 0.525 * 100 = 52.5. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 52.5 * 100 = 5250 dollars. The answer is 5250. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 5250 / 242 = 21.5. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 21.5 * 100 = 2150 dollars. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 2150 / 242 = 9.17. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 9.17 * 100 = 920.7. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 920.7 / 242 = 3.79. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 3.79 * 100 = 379.9. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 379.9 / 242 = 1.55. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 1.55 * 100 = 155.5. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 155.5 / 242 = 0.65. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 0.65 * 100 = 65.5. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 65.5 / 242 = 0.27. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 0.27 * 100 = 27.7. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 27.7 / 242 = 0.11. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 0.11 * 100 = 11.1. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 11.1 / 242 = 0.045. Therefore, each t-shirt contains 0.045 * 100 = 4.5.
