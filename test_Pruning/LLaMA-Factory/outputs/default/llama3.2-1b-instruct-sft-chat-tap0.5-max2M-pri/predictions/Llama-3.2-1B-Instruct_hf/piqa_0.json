To find the day of the week for the current day, we can subtract 2023 from 27 and take the remainder as the day of the week.\n\n27 - 2023 = -1996, which is equivalent to 1996 - 2023 = -27.

A cut is a way of cutting a day, which involves removing a certain number of days from the day.\n\nIn this case, we are cutting the day from December 2023 to today 27 Jun 2025. To find the day of the day after this, we need to count the number of days that have passed.\n\nThe first day of the day is December 2023. The next day is today 27 Jun 2025. We can count the number of days that have passed:\n\n* 2025 is a leap year, so it has 366 days.\n* 2024 is a leap year, so it has 366 days.\n* 2023 is a leap year, so it has 366 days.\n\nIn total, there are 366 + 366 + 366 = 732 + 366 = 1092 days that have passed.\n\nSince there are 365 days in a week, we can divide 1092 by 365 to find the number of weeks and the remaining days:\n\n1092 ÷ 365 = 2 weeks and 62 days\n\nSo, there are 2 weeks and 62 days that have passed. Since the day of the day is today 27 Jun 2025, we can add 62 days to find the day of the day after the 2 weeks:\n\n27 Jun 2025 + 62 days = 27 Jun 2025 + 2 weeks = 27 Jun 2025 + 2 weeks + 0 days\n\nTherefore, the day of the day after the 2 weeks is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
