They were then walking by 27 Jun 2025.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the day of the week\nTo determine the day of the week, we can use the fact that December 2023 is a leap year. A leap year has 366 days, and a non-leap year has 365 days. Since 27 Jun 2025 is a non-leap year, we can calculate the day of the week as follows:\n\n27 Jun 2025 = 2025 - 27 = 1998 days\n\n1998 days is equivalent to 1998 mod 7 = 6 days\n\nSo, December 2023 is 6 days after a multiple of 7.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the day of the week\nSince 6 days is equivalent to 6 mod 7 = 6, we can conclude that December 2023 is 6 days after a multiple of 7.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the day of the week\nDecember 2023 is 6 days after a multiple of 7, which means it is 6 days after December 2023.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the day of the week\nDecember 2023 is 6 days after a multiple of 7, which means it is 6 days after December 2023.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$",

Then, the number of days between the two dates is x - 27.\n\nSince Jan took the guests to NYC, the number of days between the two dates must be a multiple of 24 (the number of days in a week). Therefore, we can write:\n\nx - 27 = 24k\n\nwhere k is an integer.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = 24k + 27\n\nSince Jan took the guests to NYC, the number of days between the two dates must be a multiple of 24. Therefore, we can write:\n\n24k + 27 = 24m\n\nwhere m is an integer.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n24k = 24m - 27\n\nDividing both sides by 24, we get:\n\nk = m - 1.125\n\nSince k must be an integer, we can round down to k = m - 1.\n\nSubstituting k = m - 1 into the equation x = 24k + 27, we get:\n\nx = 24(m - 1) + 27\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nx = 24m - 24 + 27\n\nx = 24m + 3\n\nSince Jan took the guests to NYC, the number of days between the two dates must be a multiple of 24.
