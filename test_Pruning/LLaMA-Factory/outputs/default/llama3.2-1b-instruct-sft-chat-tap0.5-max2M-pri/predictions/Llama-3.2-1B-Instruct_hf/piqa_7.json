To determine the day of the week, we can divide 450 by 360 (since there are 360 degrees in a day). 450 divided by 360 is 1 with a remainder of 90. This means that the day of the oven is 90 degrees after a multiple of 360, which is a Sunday.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the day of the week for the day of the oven\nSince the day of the oven is 90 degrees after a multiple of 360, and December 2023 is a Sunday, we can determine the day of the week for the day of the oven by adding 90 to Sunday.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the day of the week for the day of the oven\nSunday + 90 = Monday\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Monday}$",

There are 8 x 12 = 96 teaspoons in 8x8x2 inch baking pan.\n\nTo find the number of teaspoons, we can divide the total amount of mixture (63 teaspoons) by the number of teaspoons in the baking pan (96):\n\n63 ÷ 96 = 0.65625\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

We know that 1 cup = 8 minutes x 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nSo, 1/2 cup = 16/2 = 8 cups, and 1 1/2 cups = 16/2 = 8 cups.\n\nNow, let's convert the volume of the mixture to cups. We know that 1 cup = 8 minutes x 2 = 16 minutes.\n\nSo, 8 cups = 8 x 16 = 128 cups.\n\nNow, let's convert the volume of the mixture to teaspoons.

The total capacity of the jar is not given, but we can assume it is 1 unit for simplicity. So, the amount of water in the jar is (3/4) * 1 = 0.75 * 1 = 0.75 units.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the amount of water that needs to be turned off.\nSince the faucet is turned off after filling 3/4 of the jar, the amount of water that needs to be turned off is 1 - 3/4 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 units.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the amount of water that needs to be filled with water.\nThe amount of water that needs to be filled with water is the amount of water in the jar minus the amount of water that needs to be turned off. So, the amount of water that needs to be filled with water is 3/4 - 1/4 = 0.75 - 1/4 = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5 units.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the amount of water that needs to be turned off.\nThe amount of water that needs to be turned off is 1 - 3/4 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 units.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the amount of water that needs to be filled with water.\nThe amount of water that needs to be filled with water is the amount of water in the jar minus the amount of water that needs to be turned off.

Since 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days, we can count the days as follows:\n\n- 52 weeks = 52 x 7 = 364 days\n- 2 extra days = 2 days\n\nSo, December 2023 is 364 days after a multiple of 7 days, which is a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 2023 is a multiple of 7 days.\n\nSince 27 Jun 2025 is 2 days after December 2023, we can count 2 days forward to find the day of the week for December 27:\n\n- 27 Jun 2025 is 2 days after December 2023, so it is 2 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 2 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n- 2 days after 2025 is 2025 + 2 = 2027\n\nTherefore, December 27 is 2027 days after December 2023.\n\nSince 2027 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days, we can count 365 days forward to find the day of the week for December 27:\n\n- 365 days after 2025 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n- 365 days after 2025 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n- 365 days after 2025 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n- 365 days after 2025 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n- 365 days after 2025 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n- 365 days after 2025 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days. Therefore, December 27 is 365 days after a multiple of 7 days.\n\n-",
