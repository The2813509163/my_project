However, we can try to find the line of the cookie tins that passes through the point 27 Jun 2025.\n\nOne possible approach is to use the fact that the line of the cookie tins is a straight line. We can use the slope of the line to find the equation of the line.\n\nLet's assume that the line of the cookie tins is a straight line with a slope of 1. Then, the equation of the line can be written as:\n\ny = x + b\n\nwhere b is the y-intercept.\n\nWe know that the line passes through the point 27 Jun 2025, so we can substitute x = 27 and y = 2025 into the equation to solve for b:\n\n2025 = 27 + b\nb = 1998\n\nNow that we have the equation of the line, we can substitute b = 1998 into the equation to find the equation of the line:\n\ny = x + 1998\n\nThis is the equation of the line of the cookie tins that passes through the point 27 Jun 2025.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",

This means we will use the 3 parts of powdered sugar to create a new ant bait.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the homemade ant bait\nSince we have 3 parts of powdered sugar, we will use 3/3 = 1 part of the new ant bait. This will be the 1 part borax.\n\n## Step 4: Place the new ant bait\nNow we need to place the new ant bait in the bottle caps. We will do this by placing 1 container of the new ant bait in the bottle caps.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the container\nThe container will be filled with the 1 part of the new ant bait, which will be the 1/3 of the new ant bait. This will be the container filled with the 1 part of the new ant bait.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the container\nThe container will be filled with the 1 part of the new ant bait, which will be the 1/3 of the new ant bait. This will be the container filled with the 1 part of the new ant bait.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
