Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 45 / 85 = 0.529. Since there are 365 years in a year, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 189.529 / 365 = 0.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 189.529 / 365 = 0.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 189.529 / 365 = 0.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 189.529 / 365 = 0.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529.

Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 189.529 / 365 = 0.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 189.529 / 365 = 0.529. Therefore, the number of visitors per year is 0.529 * 365 = 189.529.
