To find the number of hours it takes to reach the end of the cave, we divide the depth of the cave by the speed: 1218 / 17 = 72. Therefore, it takes 72 hours to reach the end of the cave. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it will take 72 / 24 = 3 days to reach the end of the cave. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it will take 3 days to reach the end of the cave. Since there are 3 chapters in the cave, each chapter will have 3 * 24 = 72 pages. The answer is 72. Therefore, each chapter has 72 pages.\n\nAnswer: The answer is \\boxed{72}.",
