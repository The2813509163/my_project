A drug addiction is a measure of the amount of medication used to recover.\n\nLet's assume that the drug addiction is 1 unit of medication. This means that the amount of medication used to recover is 1 unit.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditions:\n\n* Others want to maintain a safe distance from Aubrey until they recover. This means that the amount of medication they need to maintain is at least 1 unit.\n* Others want to assist Aubrey with rehabilitation options to combat the addiction. This means that the amount of medication they need to maintain is at least 1 unit.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can conclude that Others will want to do next to maintain a safe distance from Aubrey until they recover.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]",
