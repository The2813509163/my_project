To find the day of the day after December 2023, we need to subtract 27 days from 365 (the number of days in a year).\n\n365 - 27 = 338\n\nSo, the day of the day after December 2023 is 338 days after December 2023.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 338 by 7 to find the number of weeks and the remaining days:\n\n338 รท 7 = 47 weeks and 5 days\n\nThis means that 338 days is equal to 47 weeks and 5 days. Since 47 weeks is a multiple of 7 days, it will end on the same day of the week as December 2023.\n\nTherefore, the day of the day after December 2023 is 338 days after December 2023, which is 5 days after December 2023.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]",
