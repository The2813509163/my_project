        "prediction": "The original fabric was 2025, but the new fabric is 27. To find the new fabric size, we need to divide 27 by 2025.\n\n27 ÷ 2025 = 0.0138\n\nSo, the new fabric size is 0.0138. To find the new fabric size, we need to take a similar piece of fabric and cut it to the right size, then staple it on.\n\nThe new fabric size is 0.0138 × 2025 = 0.2667\n\nSo, the new fabric size is 0.2667.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0.2667} \\]",
