Minerals: The minerals can reduce the absorption of the soil in the flood plain and affect the growth of plants in the area. This means that the minerals can reduce the absorption of the soil in the flood plain by a certain amount.\n\n2. Limitment factor: The limit factor is the amount by which the minerals can reduce the absorption of the soil in the flood plain.
