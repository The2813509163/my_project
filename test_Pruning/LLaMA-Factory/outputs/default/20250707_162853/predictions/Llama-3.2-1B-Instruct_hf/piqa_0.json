The grapes are cut from December 2023 to today 07 Jul 2025. This means the grapes are cut from January 1 to January 7.\n\n2. The grapes are cut in pieces about 3 feet long. To find the number of pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces by 3.\n\n3. For each piece, we need 4 buds. So, the total number of buds is 4 times the number of pieces.\n\n4. The total number of buds is 4 times the number of pieces, which is 4 x 7 = 28.\n\n5. Since each cutting will produce a new plant that will germinate again, the number of plants that germinate is equal to the total number of buds.\n\n6. Therefore, the number of plants that germinate is 28.\n\n7. The answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{28} \\]",
