He lost some of his marbles at the playground. Let's say he lost x pages. Then, he had 198 - x pages in each chapter. He had 3 chapters, so he had 3 * 198 = 594 pages in total. He lost 3x pages, so he had 594 - 3x pages. He had 19 more marbles than Doug, so he had 19 + 3x pages. He had 3 chapters, so he had 3 * 198 = 594 pages in total. He had 3x pages in each chapter, so 3 * 594 = 1776 pages. He had 3x pages in each chapter, so 3 * 1776 = 5292 pages. He had 594 - 3x pages, so 594 - 3x = 5292.

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 12 hours on learning English and Chinese. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 12 minutes to minutes: 12 / 60 = 0.2 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 0.2 hours on learning English and 0.2 hours on learning Chinese. The total number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese is 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes. Therefore, Ryan spends 24 minutes on learning English and 24 minutes on learning Chinese. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 24 minutes to hours: 24 / 60 = 0.4 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 0.4 hours on learning English and 0.4 hours on learning Chinese. The total number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese is 0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 0.8 * 60 = 48 minutes. Therefore, Ryan spends 48 minutes on learning English and 48 minutes on learning Chinese. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 48 minutes to hours: 48 / 60 = 0.8 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 0.8 hours on learning English and 0.8 hours on learning Chinese. The total number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese is 0.8 + 0.8 = 1.6 hours. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 1.6 * 60 = 96 minutes. Therefore, Ryan spends 96 minutes on learning English and 96 minutes on learning Chinese. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 96 minutes to hours: 96 / 60 = 1.6 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 1.6 hours on learning English and 1.6 hours on learning Chinese.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to 1 group with 192 oranges and 1 group with 192 bananas.
