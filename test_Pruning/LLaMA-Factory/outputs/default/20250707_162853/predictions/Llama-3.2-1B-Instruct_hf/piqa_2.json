This means we need to fold each loose end in half so it sticks onto itself. Since there are 12 months, we need to fold each loose end in half 6 times (half of 12 months).\n\n## Step 2: Counterclockwise twist\nAfter folding each loose end in half, we need to give a counterclockwise twist to loose the bulb. This means we need to counterclockwise twist to loose the bulb.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total counterclockwise twist\nSince there are 12 months, and each month has 6 folds, we need to calculate the total counterclockwise twist. The total counterclockwise twist is 6 folds * 12 months * 2 folds = 144 folds.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total counterclockwise twist\nSince each fold is counted twice (once for each end), we need to divide the total counterclockwise twist by 2 to get the actual counterclockwise twist.
