We also need to use a sharpie to trace around the outline. Then, we need to shape the mask to its face by holding the mesh in front of your face with your index fingers right over the eyes. Finally, we need to press the mesh onto your face, making indentations where your eyes are, moulding over the ridge of your nose, and curving around your forehead and cheeks.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the steps to create the mask Armature\nThe steps to create the mask Armature are as follows:\n1. Lay the mask outline on top of the mesh so it is parallel to the grain of the mesh. This will create a shape that is parallel to the grain of the mesh.\n2. Use a sharpie to trace around the outline. This will create a shape that is shaped over the ridge of your nose, with the index fingers right over the eyes.\n3. Shape the mask to its face by holding the mesh in front of your face with your index fingers right over the eyes.
