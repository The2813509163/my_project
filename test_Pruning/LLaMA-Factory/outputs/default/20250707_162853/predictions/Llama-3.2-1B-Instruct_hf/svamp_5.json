To find the total number of points scored, we add the bonus points: 82 * 79 = 6398. Therefore, the total number of points scored is 8489. To find the total number of points scored in 79 games, we divide the total number of points scored by the number of games: 8489 / 79 = 107.84. Therefore, the total number of points scored in 79 games is 108 points. To find the total number of points scored in 1 game, we divide the total number of points scored in 79 games by the number of games: 108 / 79 = 1.38.

To find the total number of points scored in 1 game, we multiply the total number of points scored in 1 game by the number of games: 1.38 * 79 = 109.42. Therefore, the total number of points scored in 1 game is 109.42. To find the total number of points scored in 1 game, we add the total number of points scored in 1 game to the total number of points scored in 79 games: 108 + 109.42 = 217.42.

Therefore, the total number of points scored in 1 game is 2.76. To find the total number of points scored in 1 game, we multiply the total number of points scored in 1 game by the number of games: 2.76 * 79 = 177.42. Therefore, the total number of points scored in 1 game is 177.42. To find the total number of points scored in 1 game, we add the total number of points scored in 1 game to the total number of points scored in 79 games: 177.42 + 107.42 = 284.84.

Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail is 1088 - 68 = 920. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail is 920 / 4 = 230. Therefore, each piece of junk mail is 230 / 4 = 57.5.
