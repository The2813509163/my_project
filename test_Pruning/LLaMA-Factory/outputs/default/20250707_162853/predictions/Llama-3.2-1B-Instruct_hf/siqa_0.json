It is a reference point where a person is able to understand the relationship between their own and the person who is being talked.\n\nIn this case, the person who is being talked is December 2023, and the person who is remy is December 07 Jul 2025.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Remy is a good reference point: In this case, the person who is being talked is a good reference point, and the person who is remy is also a good reference point. This means that the person who is being talked is a good reference point, and the person who is remy is also a good reference point.\n\n2. Remy is not a good reference point: In this case, the person who is being talk is not a good reference point, and the person who is remy is not a good reference point. This means that the person who is being talk is not a good reference point, and the person who is remy is not a good reference point.\n\n3. Remy is an uncertain reference point: In this case, the person who is being talk is an uncertain reference point, and the person who is remy is not a good reference point. This means that the person who is being talk is an uncertain reference point, and the person who is remy is not a good reference point.\n\nBased on these scenarios, we can conclude that the person who is being talk is a good reference point, and the person who is remy is also a good reference point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]",
