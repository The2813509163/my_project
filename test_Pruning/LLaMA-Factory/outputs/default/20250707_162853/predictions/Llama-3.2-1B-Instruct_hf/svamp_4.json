Since each apple has 4 apples, the number of apples Jake has is 9 * 4 = 36. Therefore, Jake has 36 apples. Since each banana has 2 apples, the number of bananas Jake has is 36 / 2 = 18. Therefore, Jake has 18 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 18 * 2 = 36. Therefore, Jake has 36 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 36 * 2 = 72. Therefore, Jake has 72 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 72 * 2 = 144. Therefore, Jake has 144 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 144 * 2 = 288. Therefore, Jake has 288 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 288 * 2 = 576. Therefore, Jake has 576 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 576 * 2 = 1152. Therefore, Jake has 1152 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 1152 * 2 = 2304. Therefore, Jake has 2304 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 2304 * 2 = 4608. Therefore, Jake has 4608 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 4608 * 2 = 9216. Therefore, Jake has 9216 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake has is 9216 * 2 = 18432. Therefore, Jake has 18432 bananas. Since each banana has 2 bananas, the number of bananas Jake",

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 10 + x = 594. Solving for x, we get x = 584. Therefore, there are 584 pages in total. Since there are 5 storns, the number of storns is 584 / 5 = 116.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we round down to 116 pages per storn. Therefore, there are 5 * 116 = 580 storns. The total number of pages is 584 + 580 = 1168.

Since we can't have a negative number of marbles, this means that Edwin's marbles are not enough to fill the 17 marbles Doug has. However, we can still find the number of marbles Doug has. Since Edwin has 12 marbles, and he lost 20 marbles, he has 12 - 20 = -8 marbles. But we know that Doug has 17 marbles, so he must have 17 marbles. Therefore, Doug has 17 - 8 = 9 marbles. Since each chapter has 198 pages, and each marbles have 3 pages, each chapter has 198 / 3 = 66 pages. Therefore, each chapter has 66 / 3 = 22 pages. Since there are 17 chapters, the total number of pages is 17 * 22 = 374 pages. Therefore, each chapter has 74 pages. Since each chapter has 3 pages, each group of bananas has 74 / 3 = 24.5 pages.
