We know that $T_0 = 7$ Jul 2025.\n\nThe difference in temperature is $T - T_0 = T - 7$.\n\nSince we are looking for the amount of heat required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius, we can assume that the heat capacity is proportional to the temperature. Therefore, the amount of heat required is proportional to the difference in temperature.\n\nLet's assume that the heat capacity is $k$ units of heat per unit mass. Then, the amount of heat required is $k(T - 7)$.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific heat capacity or the exact relationship between the temperature and the heat capacity, we cannot determine the exact amount of heat required.\n\nBut, if we assume that the heat capacity is proportional to the temperature, we can express the amount of heat required as a function of the temperature.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]",
