Since there are 594 pages in total, they made 8292 / 594 = 14.5 pages. Since you can't make a fraction of a page, they made 14 pages in total. Therefore, each page has 14 / 1 = 14 pages.

He spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. So, he spends 2 hours on learning English. Now, let's think step by step\nAnswer: \nLet's think step by step\nAnswer: \nLet's think step by step\nLet's say the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English is x. \nThen, the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese is x - 2. \nThe total number of hours he spends on learning English is x + (x - 2). \nSince he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, we can set up the equation: \nx + (x - 2) = 2 \nCombine like terms: \n2x - 2 = 2 \nAdd 2 to both sides: \n2x = 4 \nDivide both sides by 2: \nx = 2 \nSo, Ryan spends 2 hours on learning English. \nNow, let's think step by step\nLet's say the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English is y. \nThen, the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese is y - 2. \nSince he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, we can set up the equation: \ny + (y - 2) = 2 \nCombine like terms: \n2y - 2 = 2 \nAdd 2 to both sides: \n2y = 4 \nDivide both sides by 2: \ny = 2 \nSo, Ryan spends 2 hours on learning English. \nNow, let's think step by step\nLet's say the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English is z. \nThen, the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese is z - 2. \nSince he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese, we can set up the equation: \nz + (z - 2) = 2 \nCombine like terms: \n2z - 2 = 2 \nAdd 2 to both sides: \n2z = 4 \nDivide both sides by 2: \nz = 2 \nSo, Ryan spends 2 hours on learning English. \nNow, let's think step by step\nLet's say the number of hours Ryan",

We know that she baked 197 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 75 raisin cookies today. Let's assume she baked x chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 75 raisin cookies today. Then, the total number of chocolate chip cookies she baked yesterday and today is 197 + 75 = 272. Since she has 198 raisin cookies today, she must have baked 272 - 198 = 74 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 75 raisin cookies today. Therefore, Helen baked 74 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 75 raisin cookies today. The answer is 74 + 75 = 149. Therefore, Helen's strawberries weighed 149. The answer is \\boxed{149}.",

Therefore, there were 9 more trees in the backyard than those that died. Since each tree has the same number of pages, we can divide the number of pages in the backyard (594) by the number of trees (9) to find the number of pages in each chapter: 594 / 9 = 66.

Since each camper has 4 pages, the total number of pages is 4(34 + x). We know that the total number of pages is 198, so we can set up the equation: 4(34 + x) = 198. Solving for x, we get: 136 + 4x = 198, 4x = 62, x = 15.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a camper, we round down to 15. Therefore, the number of campers who went rowing in all is 15.
