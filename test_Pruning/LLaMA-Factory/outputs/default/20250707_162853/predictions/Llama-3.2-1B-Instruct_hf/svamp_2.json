        "prediction": "To find the number of kids Julia played with on Monday and tuesday, we need to know how many kids she played with on Monday and tuesday. We know that she played with 18 kids on Monday and 10 kids on tuesday. Let's assume that she played with x kids on Monday and y kids on tuesday. We know that x + y = 18. We also know that the total number of kids is 18 + 10 = 28. We can set up an equation to solve for x and y: x + y = 18. We can also set up another equation: x + y = 28. However, we already know that x + y = 18. This means that our initial assumption that the total number of kids is 18 is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the total number of kids is 18, and the total number of books is 2. We can set up an equation: 2 * number of books = 18. Solving for the number of books, we get: number of books = 9. Since each book has 3 pages, the total number of pages is 9 * 3 = 27. Therefore, each book has 27 / 3 = 9 pages. The answer is \\boxed{9}.",
