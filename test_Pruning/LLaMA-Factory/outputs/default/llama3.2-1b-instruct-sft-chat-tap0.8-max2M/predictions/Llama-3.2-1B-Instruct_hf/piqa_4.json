To remove pits from olives, we can use a string of chopped wood to create a pattern that will remove pits from the olives. For example, if we have a string of chopped wood that goes through the middle of the olive, we can remove pits from the olives by cutting the string at the point where the pits are located.\n4.  Since the pits are located in a triangular pattern, we can use the string of chopped wood to create a triangular pattern that will remove pits from the cherries and olives.\n5.  By using an empty slow cooker and a hard straw or chopstick to remove pits from cherries and olives, we can pit cherries without a pitter.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{B}$",
