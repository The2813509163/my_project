Then, the number of kids she played with on tuesday is x + 12. We know that the total number of kids she played with on Monday is 16 + x. Since she played tag with the same number of kids on both days, we can set up the equation: 16 + x = 16 + x + 12. This equation is true for any value of x, so we can't find the value of x from this equation. However, we can use the fact that the number of kids she played with on tuesday is equal to the number of kids she played with on Monday, which is 12. Therefore, Julia played with 12 kids on tuesday.

We know that 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day, so we can divide 244 by 294 to find the number of drums of grapes that would be filled in one day: 244 / 294 = 0.829. Then, we can multiply this number by 146 to find the total number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 146 days: 0.829 * 146 = 121.54. Since we can't have a fraction of a drum of grapes, we can round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is 122.",
