Then, we use ribbons to fasten the tube part around the doll.\n\nSince the question does not provide the exact measurements of the barbie doll, we will assume that the measurements are given in inches. Let's assume the measurements are:\n\n* Length: 12 inches\n* Width: 8 inches\n* Height: 6 inches\n\nTo make the tube dress, we need to cut out the toe part and use ribbons to fasten the tube part around the doll. Since the measurements are given in inches, we will assume that the length and width of the barbie doll are 12 inches and 8 inches, respectively.\n\nThe circumference of the barbie doll is:\n\nCircumference = 2π × Length + 2π × Width\n= 2π × 12 + 2π × 8\n= 24π + 16π\n= 40π inches\n\nSince the length of the barbie doll is 12 inches, we can cut out the toe part and use ribbons to fasten the tube part around the doll. The length of the tube part will be:\n\nLength of tube part = Circumference - Length of barbie doll\n= 40π - 12\n≈ 125.66 inches\n\nThe width of the barbie doll is 8 inches, so we can cut out the toe part and use ribbons to fasten the tube part around the doll. The width of the tube part will be:\n\nWidth of tube part = Circumference - Width of barbie doll\n= 40π - 8\n≈ 125.66 inches\n\nSince the length and width of the barbie doll are approximately 125.66 inches, we can cut out the toe part and use ribbons to fasten the tube part around the doll.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{125.66}$",
