Drill every six inches until you encounter the stud.\n\nSince the wall is not specified, we can assume that the wall is a rectangular wall with a length and width that are both integers.\n\nLet's consider a 2x2 wall. We can measure inward from the corners to find the stud:\n\n* Measure inward from the top-left corner: 2 inches\n* Measure inward from the top-right corner: 2 inches\n* Measure inward from the bottom-left corner: 2 inches\n* Measure inward from the bottom-right corner: 2 inches\n\nSince we encounter the stud at the 2x2 wall, we can drill every 6 inches until we reach the stud. The length of the wall is 2x2 = 4 inches, so we can drill 4/6 = 0.67 times 4 inches = 2.67 inches before reaching the stud.\n\nSince we can't drill a fraction of an inch, we can round up to the nearest whole number.
