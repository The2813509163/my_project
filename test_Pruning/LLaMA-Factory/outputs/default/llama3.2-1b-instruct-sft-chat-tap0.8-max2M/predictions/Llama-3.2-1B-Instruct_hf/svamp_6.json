We also know that the total number of students is 635, so we can set up another equation: number of boys + number of girls = 635. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the number of girls and then the number of boys.\n\nLet's denote the number of girls as x. Then the number of boys is x + 510. We know that the total number of students is 635, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 510) = 635. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 510 = 635. Subtracting 510 from both sides, we get: 2x = 125. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 62.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a student, this means that the number of girls is 62 and the number of boys is 62 + 510 = 572.\n\nSo, there are 572 boys in the school.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{572}.",
