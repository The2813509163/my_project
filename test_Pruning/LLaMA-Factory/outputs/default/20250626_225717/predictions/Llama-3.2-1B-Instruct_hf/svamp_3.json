        "prediction": "To find the number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese, we multiply the number of hours he spends on learning each subject by the number of subjects he is learning: 2 hours/day * 3 subjects = 6 hours. To find the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish, we multiply the number of hours he spends on learning each subject by the number of subjects he is learning: 5 hours/day * 3 subjects = 15 hours. To find the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese than he does on learning Spanish, we subtract the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish from the number of hours he spends on learning English: 6 hours - 15 hours = -9 hours. However, this is not possible, so we need to rephrase the answer to reflect that he spends more on learning Spanish than on learning English. Therefore, the correct answer is that he spends 15 hours on learning Spanish, and 6 hours on learning English. To find the number of hours he spends on learning English, we divide the number of hours he spends on learning English by the number of subjects he is learning: 6 hours / 3 subjects = 2 hours. To find the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish, we multiply the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish by the number of subjects he is learning: 15 hours / 3 subjects = 5 hours. Therefore, the number of hours he spends on learning English is 2 hours, and the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish is 5 hours. To find the number of hours he spends on learning English, we subtract the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish from the number of hours he spends on learning English: 2 hours - 5 hours = -3 hours. However, this is not possible, so we need to rephrase the answer to reflect that he spends more on learning English than on learning Spanish. Therefore, the correct answer is that he spends 2 hours on learning English, and 5 hours on learning Spanish, and the number of hours he spends on learning English is 2 hours, and the number of hours he spends on learning Spanish is 5 hours. To find the number of hours he spends on learning English, we divide the number of hours he spends on learning English by the number of subjects he is learning: 2 hours / 3 subjects = 0.67 hours.
