However, the problem doesn't provide the function, so we'll assume it's a general function that can be solved using various methods, such as numerical methods or approximation techniques.\n3.  **Break down the function**: Once we have the roots, we can break down the function into simpler components. For example, if the function is a quadratic function, we can break it down into two quadratic functions.\n4.  **Find the points of Hiccups**: Once we have the roots, we can find the points of Hiccups by solving the equations. However, without the specific function, we can't determine the exact points of HICCups.\n5.  **Combine the points of HICCups**: Once we have the points of HICCups, we can combine them to find the overall points of HICCups.

First, I need to determine the cooler temperature of the gas. Since the temperature of the gas is usually 26 degrees, I need to find the cooler temperature that is 1 percent more than 26 degrees.\n\n2.  To do this, I can use a calculator to find the cooler temperature. The cooler temperature is 26 + 0.01 = 26.01 degrees.\n\n3.  Now, I need to find the amount of gas that the cooler temperature needs to expand to reach this cooler temperature. Since the gas expands and contracts 1 percent for every 15 degrees, the amount of gas needed is 26.01 / 15 = 1.7333 degrees.\n\n4.  Finally, I need to convert this amount of gas to gallons by dividing by 9.32 (since 1 gallon = 9.32 degrees).
