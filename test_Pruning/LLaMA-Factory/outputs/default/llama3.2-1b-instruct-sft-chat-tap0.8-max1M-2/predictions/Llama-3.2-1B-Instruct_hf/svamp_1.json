We know that Jessica cut some more roses and orchids. Let's assume that she cut x roses and y orchids. We know that the total number of roses is 12, so x = 12. We also know that the total number of orchids is 21, so y = 21. Therefore, Jessica cut 12 roses and 21 orchids. The answer is \\boxed{33}.",
