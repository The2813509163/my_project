Since there are 0 weeks, the day of the week is the same as the day of the week for December 27, 2025.\n3.  Now, let's boil it in a crock pot. A crock pot is a pot that can hold a certain number of soup, but it's not specified in the problem. However, if you want to boil it in a crock pot, you can use a pot that can hold 4 soup, 5 soup, 6 soup, and so on. For example, a crock pot can hold 4 soup, 5 soup, 6 soup, 7 soup, and so on.\n4.  If you want to boil it in a frying pan, you can use a frying pan that can hold 8 soup, 9 soup, 10 soup, 11 soup, and so on.

In this case, we're looking for the point where the graph of the function changes from increasing to decreasing.\n\nHere's how to break down the problem:\n\n1.  We need to find the point where the graph of the function changes from increasing to decreasing.\n2.  This point is called a \"Hiccup\".\n\nTo find the point where the graph changes, we need to find the point where the slope of the graph changes.\n\nLet's assume the function is a quadratic function, and the graph is a parabola. The equation of a parabola can be written in the form:\n\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\n\nwhere a, b, and c are constants.\n\nTo find the slope of the graph, we need to find the derivative of the function. The derivative of a quadratic function is given by:\n\ndy/dx = 2ax + b\n\nNow, we need to find the point where the slope changes. This means that the derivative is equal to zero.\n\nLet's say the point where the slope changes is (x, y). Then, we can write:\n\n2ax + b = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to find the exact value of x, we can't determine the exact value of y.\n\nHowever, we can express y in terms of x:\n\ny = -ax\n\nSo, the point where the slope changes is (x, -ax).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{27} \\]",
