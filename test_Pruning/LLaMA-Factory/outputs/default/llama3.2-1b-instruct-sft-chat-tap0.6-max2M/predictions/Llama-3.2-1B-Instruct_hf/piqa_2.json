To store it, we need to remove the remaining time after 30 seconds, which is 30 seconds.\n\nOption B: Place the bread in the freezer in its original wrapping and remove slices as desired 5 minutes before you want them so they can eat.\n\nThis means that the bread will go through its wrapping and then be removed for 5 minutes.
