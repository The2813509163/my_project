The correct calculation is: 257 - 362 = -105, but since we can't have a negative number of girls, we need to rephrase the question. The school has 362 boys and 257 girls. The difference between the number of girls and boys is 362 - 257 = 105. This means that the school has 105 more girls than boys. However, the question asks for the number of groups of bananas, not the number of girls. Since the bananas are organized into 2 groups, we need to divide the number of groups by 2 to find the number of groups of bananas: 105 / 2 = 52.5.
