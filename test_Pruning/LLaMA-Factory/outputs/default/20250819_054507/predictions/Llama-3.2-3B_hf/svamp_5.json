We can solve this problem by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nLet's denote the number of books in the set as x. We know that x = 4, so x = 4. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of books left in the set. We can write the equation: x - (x - 2) + (x - 3) - (x - 4) + (x - 5) - (x - 6) = 0. Simplifying the equation, we get: 6x - 12 = 0. Dividing both sides by 6, we get: x - 2 = 0. Therefore, x = 2. Since x = 4, we made a mistake. Let's try again. We can write the equation: x - (x - 2) + (x - 3) - (x - 4) + (x - 5) - (x - 6) = 0. Simplifying the equation, we get: 6x - 12 = 0. Dividing both sides by 6, we get: x - 2 = 0. Therefore, x = 2.
