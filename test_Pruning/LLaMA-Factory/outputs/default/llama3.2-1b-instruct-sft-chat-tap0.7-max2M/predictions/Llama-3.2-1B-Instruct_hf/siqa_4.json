The semester is 26 days long.\n3. There are 365 days in a year, so 26 days is 26/365 of a year.\n4. Since 365 is not a multiple of 4, we need to find the remainder when 26 is divided by 4.\n5. 26 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2.\n6. So, 26 days is 2/2 of a year, which means Addison needs to finish up with school after 2/2 of a year.\n7. Since there are 365 days in a year, 2/2 of a year is 365/2 = 182.5 days.\n8. Therefore, Addison needs to finish up with school after 182.5 days.\n\nHowever, since we can't finish up with school in a fraction of a day, we can round up to the nearest whole number.
