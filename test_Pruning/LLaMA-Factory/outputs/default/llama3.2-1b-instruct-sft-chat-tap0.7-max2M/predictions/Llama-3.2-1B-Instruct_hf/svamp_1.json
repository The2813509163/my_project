We know that the total number of hours he spends on learning English and on learning Chinese is 7 hours. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x+2) = 7. Solving for x, we get: 2x + 2 = 7, 2x = 5, x = 2.5. Therefore, Ryan spends 2.5 hours on learning English and 4.5 hours on learning Chinese per day.
