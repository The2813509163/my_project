However, we can still determine the number of days in a year that are divisible by 7.\n\nThe days of the week that are divisible by 7 are: 7, 14, 21, and 28. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can divide 365 by 7 to find the number of complete weeks and the remaining days.\n\n365 ÷ 7 = 52 with a remainder of 1.\n\nThis means that there are 52 complete weeks and 1 extra day in the year.\n\nSince the question asks for the number of days in a year that are divisible by 7, we can conclude that the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{52}",
