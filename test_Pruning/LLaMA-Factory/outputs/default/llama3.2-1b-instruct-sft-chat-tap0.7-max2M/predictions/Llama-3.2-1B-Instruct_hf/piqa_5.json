Therefore, we cannot provide a specific solution to this problem.\n\nBut, if we assume that the sticks are 1 unit long and the square slice is also 1 unit long, we can proceed as follows:\n\nCut the two sticks of wood into equal length, while chopping away a diagonal piece from one end of both pieces at an angle of 45 degrees.

Therefore, the length of the piece is equal to the length of the stick.\n\nNow, take a square slice of wood with required thickness. Since the square slice is also 1 unit long, it will be a square with a side length equal to the length of the piece. Therefore, the length of the square slice is equal to the length of the piece.\n\nSince the piece is a square, it will be a square with a side length equal to the length of the piece.

Loop the horizontal belts and vertical belts in a way that the boards are even and horizontal. For example, loop the horizontal belts in a way that the first belt is horizontal and the second belt is vertical, and loop the vertical belts in a way that the first belt is horizontal and the second belt is vertical.\n4.  Use 2 old belts, loop each and string one or 2 boards between the belts, nail the boards to the belts so they are even and horizontal.\n\nThis solution works because the belts are used to loop and string the boards, and the boards are even and horizontal, which means that the shelves are even and horizontal.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Use 2 old belts, loop each and string one or 2 boards between the belts, nail the boards to the belts so they are even and horizontal.}} \\]",
