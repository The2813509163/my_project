Since the screen is a square, we need to pour 1/4 of the total amount of gravy into the bowl.\n\nLet's assume the total amount of gravy is x.

Since each day has 365 days, the total number of days is:\n\n26 days x 365 days/day = 9450 days\n\nSince the bowl is filled with 26 days, the amount of gravy poured into the bowl is equal to the amount of gravy in the bowl:\n\ny = 9450 days\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of y into the equation:\n\n9450 days = x/4\n\nTo solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\n\n4 x 9450 days = x\n\nx = 37800 days\n\nSince the bowl is filled with 26 days, we can divide the total number of days by 26 to find the number of days in the bowl:\n\n37800 days / 26 days = 1428 days\n\nNow, we can find the amount of gravy poured into the bowl:\n\ny = 1428 days\n\nSince the bowl is filled with 26 days, we can divide the total number of days by 26 to find the amount of gravy poured into the bowl:\n\ny = 26 days\n\nNow, we can find the amount of gravy poured into the bowl:\n\nx = 26 days\n\nSince the bowl is filled with 26 days, we can divide the total number of days by 26",

However, we need to consider the size of the fish tank.\n\nSince the fish will acclimate to its surroundings, it won't grow much in a small tank. But it will adjust.\n\nTo find the size of the fish tank, we can assume that the fish will grow at a constant rate, which is not specified in the problem. However, we can estimate the size of the tank by using the fact that the Betta is 12 years old.\n\nLet's assume that the fish tank will grow at a constant rate, which is x gallons per year. Then, the total amount of fish will be 2 1/2 gallons (the smallest size of the Betta) + x gallons (the growth rate).\n\nSince the fish will acclimate to its surroundings, the total amount of fish will be equal to the capacity of the tank. Let's call the capacity of the tank \"C\". Then, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 1/2 + xC = C\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3 1/2 + xC = C\n\nSubtracting 3 1/2 from both sides gives:\n\nxC = -1 1/2\n\nDividing both sides by C gives:\n\nx = -1 1/2 / C\n\nSince x is the growth rate, it must be a positive number. Therefore, we can assume that x = 0, which means the fish tank will grow at a constant rate.\n\nHowever, this is not possible, since the fish will grow at a constant rate, but the tank will grow at a constant rate, which is not specified in the problem.\n\nTherefore, we need to make an assumption about the growth rate. Let's assume that the fish tank will grow at a constant rate, which is 1 gallon per year.\n\nThen, the total amount of fish will be 2 1/2 gallons (the smallest size of the Betta) + 1 gallon (the growth rate) = 3 1/2 gallons.\n\nSince the fish will acclimate to its surroundings, the total amount of fish will be equal to the capacity of the tank.
