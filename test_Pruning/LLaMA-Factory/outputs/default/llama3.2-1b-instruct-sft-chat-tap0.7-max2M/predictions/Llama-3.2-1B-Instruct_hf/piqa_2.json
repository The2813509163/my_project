Since 366 is a multiple of 7 (52 weeks), the days of the week will repeat every 7 days.\n\nTo find the day of the week for December 2023, we can divide 366 by 7:\n\n366 รท 7 = 52 with a remainder of 2\n\nThis means that 2023 is 52 weeks and 2 days after a multiple of 7. Since 2023 is a multiple of 7, it will end on the same day of the week as 2023 - 2 days = 2021.\n\n2021 is also a leap year, so it has 366 days. Since 366 is a multiple of 7, the days of the week will repeat every 7 days.\n\nTo find the day of the week for December 2023, we can divide 366 by 7:\n\n366 รท 7 = 52 with a remainder of 2\n\nThis means that 2023 is 52 weeks and 2 days after a multiple of 7. Since 2023 is a multiple of 7, it will end on the same day of the week as 2023 - 2 days = 2021.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nDecember 2023: 2021\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{2021} \\]",

Chuck a screw eye in a variable speed drill. This means the screw hook will be driven at a constant speed, but the shape of the hook will change as the drill drives it.\n\n3.

Beat 3 egg whites (Let them warm to room temp for 30 min first) add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar. Beat with mixer until peaks form on egg whites. This will give us a mixture of vanilla and cream.\n2. Ad gradually a bit at a time, 6 tablespoons of sugar. Spoon this on baking waxed paper. This will give us a mixture of vanilla and cream.\n3. Bake in oven until egg whites are browned (about 12 min). This will give us a mixture of vanilla and cream.\n4. Enjoy.\n\nNow, let's calculate the amount of mixture:\n\n* Beat 3 egg whites: 3 x (1/2 teaspoon vanilla + 1/4 teaspoon cream) = 3 x (0.5 + 0.25) = 3 x 0.75 = 2.25 teaspoons\n* Ad gradually a bit at a time, 6 tablespoons of sugar: 6 x 0.5 = 3 teaspoons\n* Bake in oven: 2.25 teaspoons (white) + 3 teaspoons (sugar) = 5.25 teaspoons\n* Bake in oven: 5.25 teaspoons (white) + 0.5 teaspoons (vanilla) + 0.25 teaspoons (cream) = 6.25 teaspoons\n\nSince 1 teaspoon is equal to 1/4 teaspoon of tartar, we can convert 6.25 teaspoons to 6.25 x 4 = 25 teaspoons of tartar.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of mixture is 25 teaspoons of white, 25 teaspoons of cream, and 25 teaspoons of tartar.\n\nTo make low fat Meringue baked clouds at home, we need to add 6 tablespoons of sugar to the mixture. Since 1 tablespoon is equal to 3/4 teaspoon, we can convert 6 tablespoons to 6 x 3/4 = 4.5 teaspoons.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of mixture is 25 teaspoons (white) + 25 teaspoons (cream) + 25 teaspoons (tartar) + 4.5 teaspoons (sugar) = 75.5 teaspoons.\n\nSince 1 teaspoon is equal to 1/4 teaspoon of tartar, we can convert 75.5 teaspoons to 75.5 x 4/4 = ",

This means that the current day of the week is 4 weeks and 2 days.\n\nSince the question asks for the answer in December 2023, we need to calculate the number of days from the current day of the week to December 2023.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so from the current day of the week to December 2023, there are 365 - 2 = 363 days.\n\nSince 363 days is equal to 4 weeks and 3 days, we can calculate the number of days from the current day of the week to December 2023 as follows:\n\n4 weeks = 4 x 7 = 28 days\n3 days = 3 days\n\nSo, the number of days from the current day of the week to December 2023 is 28 + 3 = 31 days.\n\nSince the question asks for the answer in December 2023, we need to add 31 days to the current day of the week, which is 26 Jun 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{December 2023}} \\]",
