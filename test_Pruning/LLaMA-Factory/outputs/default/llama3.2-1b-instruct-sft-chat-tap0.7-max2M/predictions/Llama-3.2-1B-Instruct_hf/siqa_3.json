There are 30 days in a month, so 9 months is equal to 9 x 30 = 270 days.\n\nNow, subtracting 270 days from the total number of days, we get 1095 - 270 = 825 days.\n\nSince Jan was nine months pregnant, we need to calculate the number of days from June 2025 to August 2025. There are 365 days in a year, except for leap years which have 366 days. So, from June 2025 to August 2025, there are 365 + 366 + 365 = 731 + 365 = 1096 days.\n\nNow, subtracting 1096 days from the total number of days, we get 825 - 1096 = -271 days.\n\nSince we can't have a negative number of days, this means that Jan is 271 days late in August 2025.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]",
