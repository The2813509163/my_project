The Earth's rotation around the Sun is the most likely cause of an earthquake, as it causes the Earth to rotate faster, resulting in a larger angular velocity of the Earth's surface relative to the Earth's center of rotation.

Both of these processes can happen in the same area at the same time, so the toxic heavy metals can move from the soil to the lakes and streams in both runoff and transpiration. The answer is A.",
