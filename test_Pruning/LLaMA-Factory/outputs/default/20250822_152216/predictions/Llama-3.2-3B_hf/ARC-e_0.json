        "prediction": " D\nExplanation: Convection is the transfer of heat through the medium (air) to the surface of the water. Since the air is cooler than the water, the heat will transfer to the surface of the water, causing the water to be cooler than the air. This is the opposite of what happens when radiation is absorbed by an object, causing it to heat up. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Conduction is the transfer of heat through a substance (water) to another substance (air), but the heat is not transferred to the surface of the water. Radiation is the transfer of heat to an object, but the heat is not transferred to the surface of the water. Evaporation is the transfer of heat from the surface of the water to the air, but this is not the case here.
