However, since we can't have a negative number of action figures, this means Jerry actually removed some action figures from the shelf. Let's recalculate: 8 - 10 = -2. Since we can't have a negative number of action figures, we can say that Jerry removed 10 action figures and added some more. Let's say he added x action figures. Then, the total number of action figures is 8 + x. Since Jerry removed 10 action figures, we can set up the equation: 8 + x - 10 = 8. Solving for x, we get: x = 0.

How many books are there in total?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nLet x be the number of books that are not books of regular soda. Then, the number of books that are not books of diet soda is also x. Since the number of books that are not books of regular soda is equal to the number of books that are not books of diet soda, we can set up the equation: x = x. This equation is true for any value of x, so we need more information to find the value of x. However, we can say that the number of books that are not books of regular soda is equal to the number of books that are not books of diet soda. Therefore, the total number of books is x + x = 2x. Since the total number of books is 30, we can set up the equation: 2x = 30. Solving for x, we get x = 15. Therefore, the total number of books is 15 + 15 = 30.\n\nQuestion: The number of books that are not books of regular soda is equal to the number of books that are not books of diet soda.
