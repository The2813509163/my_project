Image result for how to figure lateral surface area of a triangle    To find the lateral surface area of a pyramid, you can find the area of each triangle, A = 1/2bh or A = 1/2lw, then multiply by the number of triangles, which would be based on the number of sides of the base; or you can take half the perimeter and multiply by the slant height then multiply again by number of triangles\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: The lateral surface area of a pyramid is the sum of the areas of the three triangular faces. The area of each triangle is 1/2bh, where b is the base length and h is the height of the triangle. Since the pyramid has three triangular faces, the total lateral surface area is 3 times the area of one triangle. The number of triangles is equal to the number of sides of the base, which is 3 in this case. So, the lateral surface area is 3 times the area of one triangle, which is 3 times 1/2bh. This is equal to 3/2bh. Since the height of the triangle is the slant height of the pyramid, we can multiply the area by the slant height to get the lateral surface area. The slant height is equal to the length of the side of the base times the sine of the angle between the side and the slant height. Since the base is an equilateral triangle, the length of the side is equal to the base length times the sine of 60 degrees. So, the slant height is equal to the base length times the sine of 60 degrees. The area of the triangle is 1/2bh, so the lateral surface area is 3/2bh times the slant height, which is 3/2bh times the base length times the sine of 60 degrees. This is equal to 3/2bh times the base length times 1/2, which is equal to 3/4bh times the base length. Since the base length is equal to the perimeter of the base times the sine of 60 degrees, the lateral surface area is equal to 3/4bh times the perimeter of the base times the sine of 60 degrees. This is equal to 3/4 times the perimeter of the base times the sine of 60 degrees. The perimeter of the base is equal to the base length times the number of sides, which is 3. So, the lateral surface area is equal to 3/4 times 3 times the sine of 60 degrees, which is equal to 9/4 times the sine of 60 degrees. The sine of 60 degrees is equal to sqrt(3)/2, so the lateral surface area is equal to 9/4 times sqrt(3)/2, which is equal to 9sqrt(3)/8. This is the same as the answer choice B.\nAnswer:",
