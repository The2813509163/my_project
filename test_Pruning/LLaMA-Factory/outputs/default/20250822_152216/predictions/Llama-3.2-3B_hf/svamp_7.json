Let's say the number of books in the library is x. Then the number of books in the classroom is 4x. The number of books in the classroom is 3 times the number of books in the library. Let's say the number of books in the classroom is y. Then x = 3y. We know that the number of books in the classroom is 4 times the number of books in the library. So y = 4x. We can substitute x = 3y into y = 4x to get y = 4(3y) = 12y. We can substitute y = 12y into x = 3y to get x = 3(12y) = 36y. We can substitute x = 36y into y = 4x to get y = 4(36y) = 144y. We can substitute y = 144y into x = 3y to get x = 3(144y) = 432y. We can substitute x = 432y into y = 4x to get y = 4(432y) = 1728y. We can substitute y = 1728y into x = 3y to get x = 3(1728y) = 5184y. We can substitute x = 5184y into y = 4x to get y = 4(5184y) = 20736y. We can substitute y = 20736y into x = 3y to get x = 3(20736y) = 62148y. We can substitute x = 62148y into y = 4x to get y = 4(62148y) = 250592y. We can substitute y = 250592y into x = 3y to get x = 3(250592y) = 756816y. We can substitute x = 756816y into y = 4x to get y =",
