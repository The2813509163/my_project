        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The inner core is composed of a solid mixture of nickel and iron. This is because the inner core is made up of the core of the Earth, which is a solid mixture of iron and nickel. The core of the Earth is a shell of thickness 1 to 2 km, which is located below the lithosphere and the outer core. The core is made up of a solid mixture of iron and nickel, which is the same as the core of the Earth. Therefore, the answer is A. The inner core is composed of a solid mixture of nickel and iron.
