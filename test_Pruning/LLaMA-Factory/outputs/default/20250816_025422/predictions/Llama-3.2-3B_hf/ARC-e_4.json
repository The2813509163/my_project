        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: Nonrenewable resources are those that cannot be replenished by natural processes. Since petroleum is derived from natural resources (oil), it is considered nonrenewable. However, sand and wood are renewable resources because they can be replenished by natural processes (e.g., sand can be made by crushing and grinding). Oxygen is also a renewable resource because it can be replenished by natural processes (e.g., oxygen can be obtained by breathing). Therefore, the correct answer is A, which is petroleum. However, the question asks for a resource that is nonrenewable, and the correct answer is A, which is petroleum. But the question is not clear about what is a nonrenewable resource.

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: When the source of light is removed, the organism will grow in size because it will no longer receive the energy needed to maintain its size. This is because the energy needed to maintain the size of the organism is derived from the light source, and when the light source is removed, the organism will no longer receive this energy. As a result, the organism will grow in size, but it will not produce less energy or generate more waste. It will simply grow in size. The correct answer is A.",

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation:\nPotential energy is the amount of energy that a system can store due to its configuration. It is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual components of the system. In this case, the potential energy of the system is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual components.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a falling rock is equal to the potential energy of the system minus the initial potential energy. Since the rock is falling from rest, its initial potential energy is zero. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the rock is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a burning match is equal to the potential energy of the system minus the initial potential energy. Since the match is burning, its initial potential energy is zero. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the match is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a liter of gasoline is equal to the potential energy of the system minus the initial potential energy. Since the gasoline is at rest, its initial potential energy is zero. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the gasoline is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a red-hot piece of iron is equal to the potential energy of the system minus the initial potential energy. Since the iron is at rest, its initial potential energy is zero. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the iron is equal to the potential energy of the system.\n\nSince the kinetic energy of the rock is equal to the potential energy of the system, the best example of potential energy is a fallen rock.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]",
