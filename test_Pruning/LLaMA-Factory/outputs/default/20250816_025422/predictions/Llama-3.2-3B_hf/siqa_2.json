Therefore, the correct answer is \"bored\". However, the question asks for a description, so we need to think of a different word that describes Tracy's state of mind. Since he was not bored, we can say that he was \"brave\" to get away from the city. Therefore, the correct answer is \"brave\". However, this is not the only possible answer, as the question does not specify what is \"brave\" or \"bored\". In this case, we can say that Tracy was \"brave\" to get away from the city, but we cannot be sure what \"brave\" means.

        "prediction": " C\nExplanation:\nSasha's wetting the bed is a sign of a bad dream. A bad dream would make Sasha feel insecure about her ability to control her bladder. However, the question asks how Sasha would feel afterwards, not how she would feel before. So, the answer is not related to the bad dream itself, but rather to how she would feel after the wetting. Since the wetting is a sign of a bad dream, Sasha would feel the need to clean up right away, but that's not the question. The question is how she would feel afterwards, which is not related to the bad dream. However, the answer choices are not related to the bad dream either. The only answer choice that is related to the wetting is \"the need to clean up right away\".
