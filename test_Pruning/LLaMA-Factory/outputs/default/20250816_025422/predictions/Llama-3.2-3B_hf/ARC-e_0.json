Which information would help the scientist most to make her decision?\nA. size of the cells of the organism\nB. what the organism eats\nC. how many types of cells are in the organism\nD. how fast the organism grows\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The size of the cells of the organism is the most important piece of information to determine whether the organism is unicellular or multicellular. If the organism is unicellular, then all of its cells are the same size. If the organism is multicellular, then its cells are of different sizes. Therefore, the size of the cells of the organism is the most important piece of information to make the decision.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]",

        "prediction": " C\n\nExplanation:\nThe cause of the revolution is due to gravitational force, which is the force that acts on an object in the direction of the gravitational field. In this case, the gravitational field is the Sun, and the object is the planet. Since the planet is revolving in a counterclockwise direction, the gravitational force is acting in the opposite direction of the planet's velocity. Therefore, the cause of the revolution is gravitational force.\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]",
