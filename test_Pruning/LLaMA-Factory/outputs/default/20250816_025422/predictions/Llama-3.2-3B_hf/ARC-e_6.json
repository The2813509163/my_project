        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The force of gravitational attraction between Earth and any object on Earth is measured as mass. This is because the mass of an object is the amount of weight it has, and the weight of an object is the force acting on it in the direction of gravity. Therefore, the force of gravitational attraction between Earth and any object on Earth is equal to the mass of the object.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: The air in front of the meteor is compressed as it passes through the atmosphere of Earth. This causes the meteor to gain mass. The meteor will also gain velocity and increase in surface area as it passes through the atmosphere of Earth. However, the question asks for the answer that is most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. Therefore, the answer is the one that is most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor, which is the gain in mass. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. Therefore, the answer is A. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. Therefore, the answer is A. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. Therefore, the answer is A. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor. Therefore, the answer is A. The gain in mass is the most directly affected by the compression of the air in front of the meteor.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: A fruit fly has 2 parents, one from each parent of the fertilized egg. Since the egg is fertilized, it will have 2 different parents. The percentage of genes that the fertilized egg receives from one parent is 50%. This is because the egg has half of its genes from the parent that is not the parent of the egg, and the other half from the parent that is the parent of the egg. Therefore, the answer is 50%. The correct answer is B. The answer is not 25% or 75%. The answer is not 100% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 50% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 25% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 75% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 100% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 50% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 25% because the egg is not a whole gene. The answer is not 75% because the egg is not a whole gene.
