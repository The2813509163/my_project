        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: Subduction zones are the most likely locations for seafloor spreading, as they are where the ocean's water level is changing due to the movement of the Earth's crust. This change in water level causes the seafloor to shift, resulting in the formation of subduction zones. Mid-ocean ridges are not likely locations for seafloor spreading, as they are where the Earth's crust is moving in a horizontal direction, not vertically.

        "prediction": " A. They both make their own food.\nExplanation:\nCows and grass are both animals, but they are not the same species. However, they both have the ability to grow and make their own food. Since cows are animals, they take in oxygen to survive. Grass is a plant, so it does not take in oxygen to survive.

The carbon cycle involves the movement of carbon between different forms and between different locations on the Earth's surface. Fossil fuels are used to generate heat and light, which in turn are used to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) through the process of burning.
