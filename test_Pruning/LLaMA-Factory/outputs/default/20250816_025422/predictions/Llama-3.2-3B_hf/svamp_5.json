If he has to pay $ 216 rent every week How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the total amount of money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we subtract the total amount of rent he has to pay ($216 * 1181) from his total earnings ($491 * 1181). However, since the question asks for the amount of money he will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings first. Total earnings = $491 * 1181 = $578,491. Total earnings - total rent = $578,491 - $216 * 1181 = $578,491 - $256,376 = $322,115. Therefore, Lewis will have $322,115 at the end of the harvest season.
