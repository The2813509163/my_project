Volcanic eruption occurs when a volcano erupts, causing a large amount of ash and debris to be thrown out. This debris can then be blown around by wind, causing a hole in the ground. Chemical weathering is a process that occurs when a substance is exposed to air and water, causing it to break down. This process does not contribute to the formation of a sinkhole.
