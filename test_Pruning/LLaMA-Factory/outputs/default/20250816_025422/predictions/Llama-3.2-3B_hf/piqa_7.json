This form is usually achieved by running quietly, which means running at a low speed.\n\nWhen running loudly, the opposite occurs, as the speed is increased, and the time taken to cover the distance is increased. This is because the loudness of the running affects the speed, causing the runner to slow down.\n\nTherefore, to improve running form, we should try to run quietly, which means running at a low speed.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation:\nThe water content of a piece of meat is determined by the amount of water in the meat. To increase the water content of the meat, we need to add water to the meat. The most efficient way to do this is to soak the meat in a solution of salt, sugars, and spices for several hours. This will increase the water content of the meat by adding water to the existing water content.\n\nHowever, if we want to increase the water content of the meat by soaking it in plain tap water for a few minutes, we can do so by using a solution that contains a high concentration of water. For example, we can use a solution that contains 10% sodium chloride, which is a highly concentrated solution that will increase the water content of the meat.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]",
