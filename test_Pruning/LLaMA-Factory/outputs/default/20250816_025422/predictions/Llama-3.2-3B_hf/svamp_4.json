        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of packages Robin has as $x$. Since each package has 7 pieces of gum, the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is $7*x$. We know that Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum, so the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is $7*x + 6$. We are given that this total is 41, so we can write the equation $7*x + 6 = 41$. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives $7*x = 35$. Dividing both sides by 7 gives $x = 5$. Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.
