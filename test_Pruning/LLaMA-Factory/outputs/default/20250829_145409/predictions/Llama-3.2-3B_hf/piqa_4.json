The rectangles are cut to create the top and bottom layers of the pie, and the triangles are cut to create the sides of the pie. The rectangles are cut to create 3 layers of 5 inches wide, and the triangles are cut to create 3 layers of 3 inches wide. The total number of rectangles is 3 x 5 = 15, and the total number of triangles is 3 x 3 = 9. The total number of poptarts is 15 + 9 = 24. Since the poptarts are cut from the pie dough, the total number of poptarts is equal to the total number of poptarts in the pie dough. Therefore, the poptart pie dough is cut into 24 poptarts, and each poptart is cut into 2 layers of rectangles and triangles. The rectangles are cut to create 3 layers of 5 inches wide, and the triangles are cut to create 3 layers of 3 inches wide. The total number of rectangles is 3 x 5 = 15, and the total number of triangles is 3 x 3 = 9. The total number of poptarts is 15 + 9 = 24.
