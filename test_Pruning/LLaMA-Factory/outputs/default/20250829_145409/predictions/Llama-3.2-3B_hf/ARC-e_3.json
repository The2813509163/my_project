When cells die this way, they release a chemical, HMG1, which causes an inflammatory response in other cells. During this inflammatory response, cells release chemicals that promote tumor growth. What conclusion can you draw about the chemicals released in the inflammatory response?\nA. They decrease the amount of HMG1 in a feedback loop.\nB. They increase the amount of HMG1 in a feedback loop.\nC. They disrupt the normal circadian rhythms.\nD. They disrupt the normal cell cycle.\nAnswer:",
