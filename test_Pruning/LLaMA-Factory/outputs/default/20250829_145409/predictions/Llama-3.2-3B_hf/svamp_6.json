If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1 (since they are running at the same speed). Solving for x, we get: x = 5/5 = 1. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1 foot per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5) foot per hour. Since they are running together, they will be running together at the same speed. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of orchids Jessica cut as x. After cutting x orchids, the number of orchids in the vase is 3 + x. After cutting x roses, the number of roses in the vase is 16 + x. Since there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase, we can set up the following equations: 3 + x = 7 and 16 + x = 13. Solving the first equation for x, we get x = 4. Solving the second equation for x, we get x = -3, which is not possible since x cannot be negative. Therefore, we made a mistake in our previous calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the number of orchids after cutting is 7, so x = 7 - 3 = 4. We also know that the number of roses after cutting is 13, so x = 13 - 16 = -3, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem again. We know that the number of orchids after cutting is 7, so x = 7 - 3 = 4. We also know that the number of roses after cutting is 13, so x = 13 - 16 = -3, which is not possible.

If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1. Therefore, 11/5x = 1. Multiplying both sides by 5/11, we get x = 5/11. Since x represents the speed of the 5-year-old boy, we can say that the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 5/11 feet per hour. The answer is 5/11.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.
