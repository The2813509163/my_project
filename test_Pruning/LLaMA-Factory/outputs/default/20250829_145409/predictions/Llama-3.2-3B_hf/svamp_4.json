If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1. Therefore, we can solve for x: x = 1.5. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall, he runs at a speed of 5/3 feet per hour. Therefore, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of 6/3 = 2 feet per hour. Since they are running together, they will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

The answer is 198.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother. Let's denote the height of the 3-year-old boy as x. Then the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5x. Since the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5 times the height of the 3-year-old boy, we can set up the equation: 5x = 5x. This equation is true for any value of x, so we can't find the exact height of the 3-year-old boy. However, we can find the height of the 5-year-old boy: 5x. The answer is 5x.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 times as tall as his 3-year-old brother. Let's denote the height of the 3-year-old boy as x. Then the height of the 5-year-old boy is 5x.

If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x = (6/5)x. Solving for x, we get: x = 6/5x. Multiplying both sides by 5/6, we get: x = 5. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 5/6 feet per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1 foot per hour. Since they are running together, they will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x = (6/5)x. Solving for x, we get: x = 6/5x. Multiplying both sides by 5/6, we get: x = 5. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 5/6 feet per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of 6/5 feet per hour. Since they are running together, they will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.
