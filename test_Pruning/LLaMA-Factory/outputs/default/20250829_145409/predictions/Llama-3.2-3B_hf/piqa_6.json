The formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1/2bh, where b is the base and h is the height. Since the base of the pyramid is a triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area of each face. The lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the triangular faces, which is 3A, where A is the area of one face. So, the lateral surface area is 3A = 3(1/2bh) = 3/2bh.\n2.
