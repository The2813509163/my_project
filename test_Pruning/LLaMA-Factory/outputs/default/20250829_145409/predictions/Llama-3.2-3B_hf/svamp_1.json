If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per minute. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per minute. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1. Therefore, we can solve for x: x = 1.5. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall, we can set up another equation: 5/1.5 = x. Therefore, x = 3.33. Since the 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall, we can set up another equation: 6/3.33 = x. Therefore, x = 1.8. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall, we can set up another equation: 5/1.8 = x. Therefore, x = 2.78.

There are now 21 roses in the vase. How many roses are left in the garden?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the number of roses left in the garden, we subtract the number of roses in the vase (21) from the total number of roses in the garden (12): 12 - 21 = -9. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a negative number of roses. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that Jessica cut some roses from the garden. Let's say she cut x roses. Then, the total number of roses in the garden is now 12 - x. We also know that the total number of roses in the vase is now 21. Since the roses in the vase are the same as the roses in the garden, we can set up the equation: 21 = 13 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 8. Therefore, Jessica cut 8 roses from the garden. Now, we can find the number of roses left in the garden: 12 - 8 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 roses left in the garden. The answer is 4.\n\nQuestion: There are 5 people in the office. 4 people are going to have a meeting with 5 people. 5 people are going to have a meeting with 4 people.

Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1 (since they are running for 1 hour). Combining like terms, we get (11/5)x = 1. Multiplying both sides by 5/11, we get x = 5/11. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 5/11 feet per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)(5/11) = 6/11 feet per hour. Since they are running together, they will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as x.\nWe know that Danny found 29 bottle caps and now he has 42 bottle caps.\nSo the number of bottle caps he had at first is 42 + 29 = 71.\nWe also know that Danny found 82 wrappers and now he has 61 wrappers.\nSo the number of wrappers he had at first is 61 + 82 = 143.\nSince the number of wrappers and bottle caps are directly proportional to the number of wrappers and bottle caps he had at first, we can set up the following equation:\n82x = 143 * 71\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\nx = 143 * 71 / 82\n",

Solving for x, we get 2x + 10 = 594 - 3 = 591. Subtracting 10 from both sides gives 2x = 581. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 290.5. Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a peach), we round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can see that the number of green peaches is 290 + 10 = 300.

If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the speed of the 5-year-old boy is x feet per hour. Then, the speed of the 6-year-old boy is (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, their speeds are equal, so we can set up the equation: x = (6/5)x. Solving for x, we get: x = 6/5x, which implies x = 0. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy and the 6-year-old boy will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

        "prediction": " Nell had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards initially. She gave some cards to Jeff and now has 111 baseball cards and 376 Ace cards left. To find the number of cards she gave away, we subtract the number of cards she has left from the initial number of cards: 239 - 111 = 128 baseball cards given away, and 38 - 376 = -338 Ace cards given away. Since we can't have a negative number of cards, this means she gave away all her Ace cards and some of her baseball cards. However, the question asks how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has. Since she gave away all her Ace cards, she has -338 more Ace cards than baseball cards.
