The correct answer is D. A genetic mutation is the most likely cause of an altered wing shape in offspring. A genetic mutation is an alteration in the gene sequence that causes a change in the phenotype of the organism. This can occur due to a change in the DNA sequence, which can be caused by a",

        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: Gold is a metal that is malleable, meaning it can be bent and shaped without breaking. This characteristic is not unique to gold, but it is one of the reasons why gold is considered a \"soft\" metal compared to other metals. However, the question asks for a characteristic that is unique to gold, and the answer choices do not mention any other characteristic that is unique to gold. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",
