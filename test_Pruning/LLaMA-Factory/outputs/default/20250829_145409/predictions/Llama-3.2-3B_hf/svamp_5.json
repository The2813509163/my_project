How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer: Let's denote the number of children that got on the bus as x. Then the number of children that got off the bus is 63 - x. Since there were 14 children on the bus after all the transactions, we can set up the equation: x + (63 - x) = 14. Solving for x, we get x = 49. Therefore, 49 children got on the bus and 63 - 49 = 14 children got off the bus. The difference between the number of children that got on the bus and those that got off is 49 - 14 = 35. The answer is 35.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{35}$",

Since the boy is 5 years older than his brother, the boy's height is 5x = 5(3x - 3x) + 3x. Solving for x, we get 5x = 15x - 15 + 3x. Therefore, 15x - 5x = 15 + 3x. This implies 10x = 15 + 3x.

Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1. Therefore, 11/5x = 1. Multiplying both sides by 5/11, we get x = 5/11. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 5/11 feet per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)(5/11) = 6/11 feet per hour. Since they are running together, they will be running together at the same speed. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

If Ed had 91 marbles How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as x. Since Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 30 marbles. After losing 21 marbles, Ed had (x + 30) - 21 = x + 9 marbles. We know that Ed had 91 marbles, so x + 9 = 91. Solving for x, we get x = 82. Therefore, Doug had 82 marbles and Ed had 82 + 30 = 112 marbles. The difference between the number of marbles Ed had and the number of marbles Doug had is 112 - 82 = 30.

However, this is not possible since she cannot cut more roses than she threw away. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that she threw away 33 roses and then added some new roses. Since the total number of roses increased to 17, the number of new roses added is 17 - 33 = -16, which again is not possible. The correct interpretation is that she threw away 33 roses and then added some new roses, but the number of new roses added is not given. However, we can still find the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she added. Since the number of new roses added is not given, we will assume that the number of new roses added is equal to the number of roses she threw away, which is 33. Therefore, the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she added is 33 - 33 = 0. However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the problem again.

Since the total number of roses increased to 17, the number of new roses added is 17 - 33 = -16, which again is not possible. The correct interpretation is that she threw away 33 roses and then added some new roses, but the number of new roses added is not given. However, we can still find the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she added. Since the number of new roses added is not given, we will assume that the number of new roses added is equal to the number of roses she threw away, which is 33.

If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1. Therefore, we can solve for x: x = 1.5. Since the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1.5 feet per hour, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1.2 feet per hour. Therefore, they will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.
