Gently pass the yolk back and forth between the shell quarters until the egg white is removed.\nB. Crack the egg and split the shell in half.  Gently pass the yolk back and forth between the shell halves until the egg white is removed.\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " A\nExplanation: Crack the egg and split the shell in quarters.  Gently pass the yolk back and forth between the shell quarters until the egg white is removed.  This method works because the yolk is made of 2/3 of the egg, and the shell is made of 1/3 of the egg.  When you crack the egg and split the shell in quarters, you are essentially dividing the egg into 4 equal parts, with the yolk being 2/3 of one of these parts, and the egg white being 1/3 of the other 3 parts.  Since the yolk is made of 2/3 of the egg, it will be in the middle of the egg white, and it will be easy to separate it from the egg white.  Therefore, this method works, and it is the best way to separate the yolk from the egg white.\n\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Crack the egg and split the shell in quarters.
