        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: When more of the Sun's rays penetrate the atmosphere of Earth, the evaporation of oceans increases. This is because the atmosphere is made of water vapor, and when the Sun's rays penetrate the atmosphere, the water vapor is converted into liquid water, which causes evaporation. This means that the number of days with rain increases, and the number of days with clear skies decreases. Therefore, the evaporation of oceans increases, and the number of daylight hours decreases. However, the number of daylight hours is not the most likely answer choice. The correct answer choice is B. The evaporation of oceans is most likely to increase. The correct answer is B.

        "prediction": " B\nExplanation: A line graph is the best way to represent the data over time. It allows us to see the data points and the changes in the data over time. A topographic map would show the location of the earthquakes, but it would not show the changes in the data over time. A series of photographs would show the changes in the data over time, but it would not be able to represent the data points. A table of pictographs would not be able to represent the data over time. Therefore, the best way to report the strengths of these earthquakes over time is a line graph. The answer is B.",
