If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1 (since they are running at the same speed). Solving for x, we get: x = 5/5 = 1. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1 foot per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5) foot per hour. Since they are running together, they will be running together at the same speed. The answer is yes.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall. If they are running together, will they be running together at the same speed?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:\nSince they are running together, we can set up a proportion to compare their speeds. Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1 (since they are running at the same speed). Solving for x, we get: x = 5/5 = 1. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1 foot per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5) foot per hour. Since they are running together, they will be running together at the same speed. The answer is yes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

If the boy's height is 5 times the height of his brother, then the boy's height is 5 times the height of his brother. Let's think step by step\nAnswer:\nLet's denote the height of the 3-year-old brother as x. Then the height of the 5-year-old brother is 5x. Since the boy is 5 times as tall as his brother, we can set up the equation: 5x = x + x. Solving for x, we get: 4x = x, which implies x = 0. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's try again. Let's denote the height of the 3-year-old brother as x. Then the height of the 5-year-old brother is 5x. Since the boy is 5 times as tall as his brother, we can set up the equation: 5x = 5x + x. Solving for x, we get: 5x = 6x, which implies x = 0.

        "prediction": " Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers (13) and cakes (15) by the number of friends (28). For crackers, 13 / 28 = 0.464 (round down to 0 since you can't eat a fraction of a cracker), and for cakes, 15 / 28 = 0.536 (round down to 0 since you can't eat a fraction of a cake). However, since the question asks for the number of crackers and cakes each person ate, we should consider the remainder when dividing the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends. For crackers, the remainder is 13 - 0*28 = 13, and for cakes, the remainder is 15 - 0*28 = 15. Therefore, each person ate 13 / 28 = 0.464 (round down to 0) crackers and 15 / 28 = 0.536 (round down to 0) cakes.

        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of baskets as x. Since each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, the total number of peaches in each basket is 7. So, 4*4 + 3*3 = 16 + 9 = 25 peaches in each basket. Since there are x baskets, the total number of peaches is 25*x. We are given that the total number of peaches is 7. So, 25*x = 7. Solving for x, we get x = 7/25. Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a basket), this means that the problem statement is inconsistent with the given information. However, if we assume that the problem statement is correct, we can try to find a solution. In this case, we can try to find the closest integer value of x that satisfies the equation. Since 7/25 is approximately 0.28, we can try x = 1. In this case, the total number of peaches would be 25, which is less than 7. If we try x = 2, the total number of peaches would be 50, which is more than 7. Therefore, the problem statement is inconsistent with the given information, and we cannot find a solution.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the problem statement is correct, and we want to find the closest integer value of x that satisfies the equation, we can try to find the closest integer value of x that is less than or equal to 7/25. In this case, we can try x = 1. In this case, the total number of peaches would be 25, which is less than 7. If we try x = 2, the total number of peaches would be 50, which is more than 7.

Let's say the speed of the 5-year-old boy is x feet per hour. Then, the speed of the 6-year-old boy is (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x + (6/5)x = 1. Therefore, we can solve for x: x = 1.5. Since the 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall, his speed is 5/1.5 = 3.33 feet per hour. Therefore, the 6-year-old boy is running at a speed of 6/1.5 = 4 feet per hour. Since they are running together, they will not be running together at the same speed.
