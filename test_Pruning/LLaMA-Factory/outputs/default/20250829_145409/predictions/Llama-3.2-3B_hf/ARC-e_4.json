This can happen due to changes in the object's mass, which affects its distance from the starting point, or due to changes in the object's location, which affects its time of travel. However, the most common cause of a change in speed is a change in the object's mass, which causes a change in its distance from the starting point, and thus a change in its time of travel. This can be caused by a change in the object's mass due to a change in the object's temperature, which causes a change in its density, and thus a change in its mass.
