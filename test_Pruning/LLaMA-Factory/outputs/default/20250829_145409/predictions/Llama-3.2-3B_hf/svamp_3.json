        "prediction": " Let's denote the number of cups of flour Mary put in as x. Since she needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, the number of cups of sugar she put in is x - 2. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour, so x = 11. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar, so x - 2 = 7. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of x. We have 11 = x and 7 = x - 2. We can add 2 to both sides of the second equation to get 9 = x. Therefore, Mary put in 9 cups of sugar. Since she put in 11 cups of flour, she put in 11 - 9 = 2 cups of flour.

Since they are running together, we can assume that they are running at the same speed. To find their speeds, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. Since they are running together, we can assume that the time is the same for both of them. Let's denote the time as t. The distance is the same for both of them, which is the distance between them. Since they are running together, we can assume that the distance is the same for both of them. Let's denote the distance as d. The speed is the same for both of them, which is the distance / time.

Let's say the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of x feet per hour. Then, the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of (6/5)x feet per hour. Since they are running together, we can set up the equation: x = (6/5)x. Solving for x, we get: x = 6/5x. Multiplying both sides by 5/6, we get: x = 5. Therefore, the 5-year-old boy runs at a speed of 5/6 feet per hour, and the 6-year-old boy runs at a speed of 1 foot per hour. Since they are running together, they will not be running together at the same speed. The answer is no.\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is 5 feet tall and a 6-year-old boy is 6 feet tall.

Together with game they earned 22 dollars. How much did ring toss game make per day?\nLet's think step by step\nAnswer:",
        "prediction": " To find the amount of money the ring toss game made per day, we subtract the total amount of money earned by the game from the total amount of money earned by the game and the ring toss: 22 - 420 = -398. However, this is not possible since the game cannot make a negative amount of money. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The total amount of money earned by the game and the ring toss is 22 dollars. Since the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day for 30 days, we can find the amount of money it made per day by dividing the total amount of money earned by the game and the ring toss by the number of days: 22 / 30 = 0.7333.
