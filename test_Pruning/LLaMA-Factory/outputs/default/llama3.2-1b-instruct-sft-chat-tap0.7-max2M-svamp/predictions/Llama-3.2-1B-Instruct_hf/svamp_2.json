Therefore, each day they harvest 1.52 oranges. Since there are 365 days in a year, the total number of oranges harvested per year is 1.52 * 365 = 547.2. Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we round down to 547 oranges per year. If there are 4 years in a month, the total number of oranges harvested per month is 547 * 4 = 2188. If there are 12 months in a year, the total number of oranges harvested per year is 2188 * 12 = 26244. If there are 13 years in a month, the total number of oranges harvested per month is 26244 * 13 = 337328.

If there are 18 months in a year, the total number of oranges harvested per year is 19435105200 * 18 = 35378775200. If there are 19 months in a year, the total number of oranges harvested per year is 35378775200 * 19 = 66935935160. If there are 20 months in a year, the total number of oranges harvested per year is 66935935160 * 20 = 134217888000.
