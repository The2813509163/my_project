Let's call the width of Jesse's room \"w\". We can set up an equation: 7w = area of room. We don't know the area of the room, but we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. We can use this fact to find the width of Jesse's room.

However, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. We can set up an equation: 7w = area of room. We can also set up an equation: 7w = 7x, where x is the width of Jesse's room. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 7: x = 1. Then, we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to get the width of Jesse's room: w = 1. Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to get the area of the room: area of room = 7x = 7(1) = 7.
