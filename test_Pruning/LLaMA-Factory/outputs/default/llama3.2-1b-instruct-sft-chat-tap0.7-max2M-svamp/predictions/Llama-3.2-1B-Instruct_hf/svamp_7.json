We know that the total number of emails he received in the day is 5, so we can set up the equation: 5 + x = 5 + x. This equation is true for any value of x, so we need to find another equation. Let's assume Jack received 1 email in the morning and 2 emails in the afternoon. Then, the total number of emails he received in the day is 1 + 2 = 3.
