Lucy bought 1 pack of cookie and 1 pack of cake. The answer is 1.4. However, since the problem asks for the number of bananas, we can ignore the packs of cookie and cake and just say that each pack of cookie contains 198 pages.

If you have 14 bags of cookies, you can divide 14 by 14 to get the number of bags of cookies: 14 / 14 = 1. Therefore, each bag of cookies weighs 1.5 pounds. The answer is 1.5.

Since there are 2 buses in each school, the school needs to take the trip to 2 * 58 = 116 students. Therefore, the school needs to take the trip to 116 students. Since each student has 198 pages, the school needs to take the trip to 116 * 198 = 22536 pages. Since there are 2 buses in each school, the school needs to take the trip to 22536 / 2 = 11268 buses.

Since there are 2 buses in each school, the school needs to take the trip to 1416 / 2 = 728 buses. Since there are 2 buses in each school, the school needs to take the trip to 728 / 2 = 364 buses. Since there are 2 buses in each school, the school needs to take the trip to 364 / 2 = 182 buses. Since there are 2 buses in each school, the school needs to take the trip to 182 / 2 = 91 buses.

Since we can't have a fraction of a pack, we round down to 2 packs (as you can't buy a fraction of a pack). So the number of pages in each pack is 198 / 198 = 1. This means that each pack will have 1 page, and the total number of pages will be 198. Since the total number of pages is 594, the number of pages in each pack will be 594 / 198 = 3.
