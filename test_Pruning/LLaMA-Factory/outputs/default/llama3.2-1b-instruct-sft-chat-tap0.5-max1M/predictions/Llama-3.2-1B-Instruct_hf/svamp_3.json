Since it took David 30 more days to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it took to finish the book.\nSo the number of days it took to finish the book is 30. Now we divide the total number of pages (594) by the number of days it took to finish the book (30) to get the number of pages in each chapter.\nSo the number of pages in each chapter is 594 / 30 = 19.6. Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we round down to 19 pages per chapter.\nSo each chapter has \\boxed{19} pages.",

I need to recalculate the number of drums of grapes that would fill in 146 days.\nThe total number of drums of grapes is 244 + 47 = 291. \nThe number of drums of grapes that would fill in 146 days is 291 / 146 = 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04 drums of grapes. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2.04. \nSo, each group of grapes would have 2.04. \nSince we can't have a fraction of a drum, we round down to 2",
