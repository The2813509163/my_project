Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we round down to 25 weeks. Therefore, the harvest lasted for 25 weeks.\nSince each week has 7 days, we can multiply the number of weeks by 7 to get the number of days: 25 * 7 = 175 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide 175 by 24 to get the number of days: 175 / 24 = 7.44. Therefore, the harvest lasted for approximately 7 full weeks and 0.44 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 7 weeks. Therefore, the harvest lasted for 7 weeks.\nSince each week has 7 days, we can multiply the number of weeks by 7 to get the number of days: 7 * 7 = 49 days. Therefore, the harvest lasted for 49 days.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide 49 by 24 to get the number of days: 49 / 24 = 2.06. Therefore, the harvest lasted for approximately 2 full weeks and 0.06 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 2 weeks. Therefore, the harvest lasted for 2 weeks.\nSince each week has 7 days, we can multiply the number of weeks by 7 to get the number of days: 2 * 7 = 14 days. Therefore, the harvest lasted for 14 days.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we can divide 14 by 24 to get the number of days: 14 / 24 = 0.58. Therefore, the harvest lasted for approximately 0.58 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 0 days. Therefore, the harvest lasted for 0 days.\nSince the harvest lasted for 0 days, we can conclude that the harvest lasted for 0 days.\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{0}.",

So the total number of pages is 3 * 198 = 594. Since it takes 607 days to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days it takes to finish the book.\nSo the number of pages in each chapter is 594 / 607 = 0.983... Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we round down to 0.983. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we round up to 1. So each chapter has 198 pages.\nSince the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups, we can divide the number of pages in each group by 2 and then multiply by 93 to get the number of groups.\nSo each group of bananas has 198 / 2 * 93 = 99 * 93 = 8915 pages.\nSince each page is 1/3 pounds, the number of pounds in each group of bananas is 8915 / 3 = 2975 pounds.\nSo each group of bananas weighs \\boxed{2975} pounds.",

They had 81 + 60 = 141 bottles of regular soda and 60 + 60 = 120 bottles of diet soda. The difference between the number of bottles of each type is 141 - 120 = 21. Therefore, the grocery store had 21 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda. Since the problem asks for the size of each group of bananas, we assume that the 21 extra bottles of regular soda are also bananas. Therefore, each group of bananas contains 198 pages. The answer is 198. The grocery store had 198 pages in each group of bananas. The answer is \\boxed{198}.",

So the total number of kids is 2 + 14 + 16 = 16 + 16 = 32\nSince each kid has 198 pages, the total number of pages is 32 * 198 = 6352.\nSince there are 2 kids, each kid has 6352 / 2 = 3170 pages.\nSince each book has 198 pages, each book has 3170 / 198 = 16.5 pages.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a page, we round down to 16 pages per book.\nSo each book weighs 16.5 pages, which is equal to 16.5 / 198 = 0.0857, or 0.0857 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.0857 pounds, or 0.0857 / 198 = 0.0053 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.0053 pounds, or 0.0053 / 198 = 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\nSo each book weighs 0.000025 pounds.\n",
