Since we can't have a negative number of peaches, this means that Jill has 4 fewer peaches than there are in the book. But we are asked to find the number of bananas, not the number of peaches. Since there are 87 oranges and 290 bananas, we can assume that the number of bananas is the same as the number of peaches. So, the number of bananas is 4 fewer than the number of peaches. Since there are 12 peaches, the number of bananas is 12 - 4 = 8. So, each group of bananas weighs \\boxed{8} dollars.",
