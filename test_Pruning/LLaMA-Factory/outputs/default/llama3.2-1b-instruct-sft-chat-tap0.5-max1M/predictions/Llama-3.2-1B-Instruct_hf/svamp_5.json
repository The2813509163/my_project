Since the bananas weigh the same as the book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages in each group of bananas (145) to find the number of groups of bananas.\nThe number of groups of bananas is 80 / 145 = 0.5517. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to 0 groups of bananas. However, this is not possible since the bananas are organized into 2 groups and 93 groups. Therefore, we need to recalculate the number of groups of bananas.\nLet's think step by step\nThe book has 4 feet long and 20 feet wide. So the total number of pages in the book is 4 * 20 = 80",

I already calculated that it will take 24 / 8 = 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since it took 607 days to harvest the book, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Therefore, each day, it will take 3 / 8 = 0.375 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since it took 607 days to harvest the book, it will take 607 / 0.375 = 1626.67 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 1626 days. Therefore, each day, it will take 1626 / 8 = 202.5 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since it took 607 days to harvest the book, it will take 607 / 202.5 = 2.96 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 2.96 days. Therefore, each day, it will take 2.96 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since it took 607 days to harvest the book, it will take 607 / 2.96 = 19.5 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 19.5 days. Therefore, each day, it will take 19.5 / 2.96 = 5.5 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since it took 607 days to harvest the book, it will take 607 / 5.5 = 109.09 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to 109 days. Therefore, each day, it will take 109 / 5.9 = 15.9 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. Since it took 607 days to harvest the book, it will take 607 / 15.9 = 39.6 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.
