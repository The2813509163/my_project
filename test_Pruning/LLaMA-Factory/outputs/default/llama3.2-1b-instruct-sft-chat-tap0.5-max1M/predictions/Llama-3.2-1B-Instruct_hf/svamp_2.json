If white t - shirts can be purchased in packages and mom buys 14 packages, then the number of white t - shirts is 594 / 14 = 42.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a white t, I'll round down to 42 white t - shirts. Each white t - shirt has 198 pages. So, each package has 198 / 14 = 14.29 pages. Since you can't have a fraction of a page, I'll round down to 14 pages per package. So, each package has 14 * 14 = 196 pages. Since there are 14 packages, the total number of white t - shirts is 14 * 196 = 2744. Subtracting the total number of white t - shirts from the total number of white t - shirts, we get 594 - 2744 = -1890. Since you can't have a negative number of pages, I'll round down to 0. So, each package has 0 pages. Since there are 14 packages, the total number of white t - slices is 14 * 0 = 0. So, each package has 0 pages.

The total number of bottles is 57 + 26 + 27 = 83 + 27 = 110 The grocery store had 110 bottles total. Since each bottle has 12 pages, the total number of pages is 110 * 12 = 1320. Since the grocery store had 1320 pages, the number of pages in each group is 1320 / 198 = 6.67. Since the number of pages in each group must be a whole number, the grocery store had 6 full groups of 198 pages and 2 extra pages. The 2 extra pages are not part of a group, but they are part of another group. Therefore, the total number of pages in the 2 groups is 198 * 6 + 2 = 1188 + 2 = 1180, and the total number of pages is 1320. Therefore, the 2 groups of 198 pages are each containing 198 pages, and the 2 groups of 198 pages are each containing 198 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages is 198 * 2 + 198 * 2 = 396 + 396 = 792, and the total number of pages is 1320. Therefore, the 2 groups of 198 pages are each containing 198 pages, and the 2 groups of 198 pages are each containing 198 pages.

Therefore, the 2 groups of 198 pages are each containing 198 pages, and the 2 groups of 198 pages are each containing 198 pages.
