If the bananas are organized into 2 groups, then the number of bananas is 2 * 198 = 396. If the oranges are organized into 93 groups, then the number of oranges is 93 * 198 = 18336. Since the total number of oranges is 396, the number of oranges is 396 - 18336 = -18340. Since the number of oranges cannot be negative, this means that the oranges are not actually being organized into groups. However, the problem states that the bananas are organized into groups, so we need to find the number of oranges that are actually being organized into groups.
